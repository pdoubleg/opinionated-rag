      "The condition is very good.  The shade has several small chips in the porcelain.  The explosion proof fixture is nice with no problems.  The globe is good with no cracks or chips.  The cork gasket is dried out and cracked...easily replaced or could be left out.  It does use a standard base bulb.  Nice addition to any decor.\n",
