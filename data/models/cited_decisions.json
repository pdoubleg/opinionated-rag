Proa, \u00a7 1280 et seq.) is entitled to collateral estoppel, or \"issue preclusion,\" effect in favor of a <i>nonparty</i> to the arbitration.<sup>[1]</sup> Second, we must determine whether a commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policy that provides coverage for sums the insured is \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" may cover losses arising from a breach of contract.</p>\n<p>We reach the following conclusions: First, a private arbitration award, even if judicially confirmed, may not have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect under California law unless there was an agreement to that effect in the particular case.<sup>[2]</sup> Second, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> the coverage phrase \"legally obligated to pay as damages,\" as used in a CGL insurance policy, may provide an insured defendant with coverage for losses pleaded as contractual damages. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The underlying litigation involves damage to a parcel of land that Vandenberg<sup>[3]</sup> used as an automobile sales and service facility. Before 1958, owners Eugene and Kathryn Boyd<sup>[4]</sup> operated an automobile dealership on the property. From 1958 to 1988, Vandenberg leased the property from Boyd under a series of leases. In 1988 Vandenberg discontinued the business and possession of the land reverted to Boyd.</p>\n<p>To prepare the property for sale, Boyd removed three underground waste oil storage tanks. Testing revealed contamination of soils and groundwater underlying the property. Boyd filed an action against Vandenberg, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, public and private nuisance, negligence, waste, trespass, strict liability, equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The Boyd complaint alleged Vandenberg had installed and operated the waste oil storage tanks and the tanks were the source of the petroleum contamination.</p>\n<p>Vandenberg had obtained CGL insurance from several companies over the years, including Phoenix Assurance Company of New York (Phoenix), the Glens Falls Insurance Company (Glens Falls), Continental Insurance Company (Continental), TIG Insurance Corporation (TIG), Centennial Insurance Company (Centennial), and United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF &amp; G) (collectively insurers). The policies provided coverage to Vandenberg for sums he was \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" because of property damage. However, certain of the policies, including policies issued by USF &amp; G and Centennial, also contained a so-called pollution exclusion, under which property damage caused by a pollutant or contaminant was not covered except for a \"sudden and accidental\" discharge.</p>\n<p>Vandenberg tendered defense of the Boyd action to his insurers, but only USF &amp; G agreed to provide a defense. During judicially supervised settlement proceedings, Vandenberg, Boyd, and USF &amp; G reached an agreement among themselves to resolve the Boyd litigation. The agreement provided that its parties would contribute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> jointly to the investigation and remediation of the contamination, with USF &amp; G bearing the largest share of the cost. Boyd agreed to release USF &amp; G from any claims. Vandenberg agreed to release USF &amp; G from claims for bad faith, breach of the contract, and extracontractual damages. Boyd released all claims against Vandenberg except those based on the theory that the contamination constituted a breach of the lease agreements. <i>Boyd and Vandenberg</i> agreed to resolve the reserved <i>breach of lease</i> issues through arbitration or by trial, depending upon their agreement on an arbitrator and arbitration schedule. Vandenberg conditioned his agreement to the settlement upon the arbitration being \"binding.\" USF &amp; G agreed to defend Vandenberg, but the ultimate issues of USF &amp; G's coverage and indemnity obligations, as well as any claim by Vandenberg for <i>Cumis</i> counsel fees (see <i>San Diego Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Ins. Society, Inc.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164069/san-diego-federal-credit-un-v-cumis-ins-socy/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>), were <i>\"reserved for [future] resolution.\"</i> (Italics added.)<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The arbitration between Vandenberg and Boyd took place before a retired federal judge, Raul Ramirez. Formal discovery was conducted, and the transcribed proceedings included representation by counsel, and extensive evidence, briefing, and argument. In a lengthy and detailed decision, the arbitrator ruled for Boyd. Among other things, the arbitrator found that the contamination stemmed primarily from the underground waste oil tanks and was caused in part by Vandenberg's improper installation, maintenance and use of the tanks. The arbitrator indicated the discharge of contaminants was not sudden and accidental. The arbitrator's award of over $4 million to Boyd was confirmed by a superior court judgment.</p>\n<p>The insurers rejected Vandenberg's request for indemnification. He then filed the underlying action against his insurers, alleging various causes of action arising out of the failure to defend, settle, or indemnify in the Boyd action.</p>\n<p>The insurers filed two motions for summary adjudication. In the first motion, Centennial and USF &amp; G argued they had no duty to defend or indemnify because the pollution exclusion in their policies was triggered by the arbitrator's determination in the Boyd action that the contamination was not sudden and accidental. These two insurers contended that Vandenberg's relitigation of the \"sudden and accidental\" issue was precluded by principles of collateral estoppel. In the second motion, all insurers sought summary adjudication on the basis that the arbitrator awarded damages for breach of lease, a contractual cause of action, and contractual damages are not covered by the CGL insurance policies at issue.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted both motions for summary adjudication. As to the first motion, the trial court ruled that relitigation of issues regarding the source and causation of the contamination was precluded by collateral estoppel. The court reviewed the arbitration transcript and concluded the \"only reasonable inference is that the leaks or spills were occurring over a considerable period of time.\" The court found, under <i>Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Siviss Ins. Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257589\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257589/shell-oil-co-v-winterthur-swiss-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257589\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257589/shell-oil-co-v-winterthur-swiss-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, that Vandenberg had no factual basis to contend the sudden and accidental exception to the pollution exclusion in Centennial and USF &amp; G's policies applied.<sup>[6]</sup> As to the second motion, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> trial court found Vandenberg had no coverage under the policies for the arbitration award because the claims submitted to the arbitrator were contractual.</p>\n<p>After consolidating the cases, the Court of Appeal issued peremptory writs of mandate reversing both summary adjudication orders. The appellate court first held that, absent a contrary agreement by the arbitral parties, a party to private arbitration is not barred from relitigating issues decided by the arbitrator when those issues arise in a different case involving a different adversary and different causes of action. It would not be fair to give a private arbitration decision nonmutual collateral estoppel effect without the arbitral parties' consent, the Court of Appeal reasoned, because private arbitration lacks significant safeguards of court litigation, particularly the right to full judicial review.<sup>[7]</sup> The Court of Appeal also ruled that coverage under the insurance policies in question could not be determined by reference to the \"general rule\" that damages for an insured's nonperformance of a contract are not covered under CGL insurance policies. (See <i>International Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Devonshire Coverage Corp.</i> (1979) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155622\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155622/intl-surplus-lines-ins-v-devonshire-coverage/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span> (<i>International Surplus</i> ).) Rather, the court reasoned, when there is damage to property, the focus of the inquiry should be the nature of the risk or peril that caused the injury and the specific policy language, not the form of action brought by the injured party.</p>\n<p>We granted the insurers' petitions for review to consider the circumstances, if any, in which private contractual arbitration decisions may have collateral estoppel effect in favor of nonparties, and whether CGL policy language indicating coverage for sums the insured becomes \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" can include losses pled as breach of contract. We consider each issue in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Collateral estoppel is one of two aspects of the doctrine of res judicata. In its narrowest form, res judicata \"'precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a <i>cause of action</i> [finally resolved in a prior proceeding].'\" (<i>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd.</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1360212\"><a href=\"/opinion/1360212/teitelbaum-furs-inc-v-dominion-ins-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span> (<i>Teitelbaum Furs</i>), quoting <i>Bernhard v. Bank of America</i> (1942) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454918\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454918/bernhard-v-bank-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 810, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></span> (<i>Bernhard</i>).) But res judicata also includes a broader principle, commonly termed collateral estoppel, under which an <i>issue</i> \"`necessarily decided in [prior] litigation [may be] conclusively determined <i>as [against] the parties [thereto] or their privies</i> ... in a subsequent lawsuit on a <i>different</i> cause of action.'\" (<i>Teitelbaum Furs, supra,</i> 58 Cal.2d at p. 604, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span>, italics added.)</p>\n<p>Thus, res judicata does not merely bar relitigation of identical claims or causes of action. Instead, in its collateral estoppel aspect, the doctrine may also preclude a party to prior litigation from redisputing <i>issues</i> therein decided against him, even when those issues bear on different claims raised in a later case. Moreover, because the estoppel need not be mutual, it is not necessary that the earlier and later proceedings involve the identical parties or their privies. Only the party <i>against whom</i> the doctrine is invoked must be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> bound by the prior proceeding. (<i>Lucido v. Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 341, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This means that the loss of a particular dispute against a particular opponent in a particular forum may impose adverse and unforeseeable litigation consequences far beyond the parameters of the original case. (See <i>Kelly v. Trans Globe Travel Bureau, Inc.</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155231\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155231/kelly-v-trans-globe-travel-bureau-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(<i>Lucido, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, even where the minimal prerequisites for invocation of the doctrine are present, collateral estoppel \"`is not an inflexible, universally applicable principle; policy considerations may limit its use where the ... underpinnings of the doctrine are outweighed by other factors.'\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> quoting <i>Jackson v. City of Sacramento</i> (1981) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2118636\"><a href=\"/opinion/2118636/jackson-v-city-of-sacramento/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>Whether collateral estoppel is fair and consistent with public policy in a particular case depends in part upon the character of the forum that first decided the issue later sought to be foreclosed. In this regard, courts consider the judicial nature of the prior forum, i.e., its legal formality, the scope of its jurisdiction, and its procedural safeguards, particularly including the opportunity for judicial review of adverse rulings.

An independent purpose of modern private arbitration statutes is to overcome earlier judicial hostility to arbitration agreements, and to ensure that such agreements, like other legally valid contracts, are enforced in accordance with their terms.

Accordingly, policies favoring the efficiency of private arbitration as a means of dispute resolution must sometimes yield to its fundamentally contractual nature, and to the attendant requirement that arbitration shall proceed <i>as the parties themselves have agreed. (Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>Of course, the parties to a private arbitration need not, and sometimes may not, specify every detail, characteristic, and consequence of the proceeding they contemplate. As indicated above, the California statutes set forth certain basic, common characteristics of such proceedings, including their general relationship to the judicial system, that will apply even absent the specific agreement of the parties. These include, among others, the limited grounds and procedures for judicial review of a private arbitration award. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1286.2, 1286.6; <i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

By choosing private arbitration, the parties \"evince [their] intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels.\" (<i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Judicial interference with the arbitrator's decision would thus defeat the very advantages the arbitral parties sought to achieve. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> Accordingly, the parties, simply by agreeing to arbitrate, are deemed to accept limited judicial review <i>by implication,</i> particularly where their agreement specified that the award would be \"final\" and \"binding\" upon them. (<i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In effect, it is appropriate to insulate a private arbitral award from close judicial scrutiny because, given the inherent nature of arbitration, <i>\"the parties have agreed that it be so.\" (Id.,</i> at p. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

California's statutory scheme nowhere specifies that, despite the arbitral parties' failure so to agree, a private arbitration award may be binding in favor of <i>nonparties</i> in litigation involving <i>different</i> causes of action. Moreover, in our view, such a consequence is not an inherent or expected feature of private arbitration that is implicitly accepted by the arbitral parties.</p>\n<p>As we recently observed, private arbitration is a process in which parties voluntarily trade the safeguards and formalities of court litigation for an expeditious, sometimes roughshod means of resolving their dispute. The traditional rule is that \"`[a]rbitrators, unless specifically required to act in conformity with rules of law, may base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity, and in doing so may expressly or impliedly reject a claim <i>that a party might successfully have asserted in a judicial action.'</i> [Citations.] As early as 1852, this court recognized that, `The arbitrators are not bound to award on principles of dry law, but may decide on principles of equity and good conscience, and make their award <i>ex aequo et bono</i> [according to what is just and good].' [Citation.] `As a consequence, . .. \"[p]arties who stipulate in an agreement that controversies ... shall be settled by arbitration, may expect not only to reap the advantages that flow from the use of that nontechnical, summary procedure, but also to find themselves bound by an award reached by paths neither marked nor traceable and not subject to judicial review.\" [Citation.]'\" (<i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under such circumstances, each party is willing to risk that the arbitration will result in a \"final\" and \"binding\" <i>defeat</i> with respect to <i>the submitted claims,</i> even though the party would have won in court, and even though the arbitrator's errors must be accepted without opportunity for review. (See <i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

But this does not mean each arbitral party also consents that issues decided against him by this informal, imprecise method may bind him, in the same manner as a court trial, in <i>all future</i> disputes, <i>regardless</i> of the stakes, against <i>all</i> adversaries, known and unknown.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, common sense weighs against the assumption that parties contemplate such remote and collateral ramifications when they agree to arbitrate controversies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> between themselves. Logic equally suggests that conscious agreements to give arbitrators' decisions nonmutual collateral estoppel effect would not be routine. <i>The very fact</i> that arbitration is by nature an informal process, not strictly bound by evidence, law, or judicial oversight, suggests reasonable parties would hesitate to agree that the arbitrator's findings in their own dispute should thereafter bind them in cases involving different adversaries and claims. Even where, as here, the arbitral parties have imposed some formality on their proceedings, have aired their dispute thoroughly, and have received a detailed decision, there is no reason to assume they agreed to \"issue preclusive\" effect in favor of nonparties. In the usual case, tactical considerations would weigh against such an agreement. Most often, the effect would be to burden whichever party <i>lost</i> the arbitration, while affording no corresponding benefit to either arbitral party. (See Shell, <i>Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel Effects of Commercial Arbitration</i> (1988) 35 UCLA L.Rev. 623, 667.).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, there is little basis to surmise that mere silence implies the arbitral parties' acceptance of nonmutual collateral estoppel. A general rule that confirmed private arbitration awards may have such effect would thus violate the fundamental premise that private arbitration is a contractual proceeding <i>whose scope and effect are defined and limited by the parties' consent.</i> For similar reasons, such a rule would chill, rather than promote, the voluntary use of the arbitral forum as an efficient and informal alternative means of resolving particular controversies.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the public policy reasons against applying the collateral estoppel doctrine (see, e.g., <i>Lucido, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span>) well outweigh those in favor of doing so. In fact, the traditional justifications for collateral estoppel\u0097factors which \"strongly influence whether its application in a particular circumstance would be fair to the parties and constitute[ ] sound [public] policy\" (<i>Lucido, supra,</i> at p. 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

But because a private arbitrator's award is <i>outside</i> the judicial system, denying the award collateral estoppel effect has no adverse impact on judicial integrity. Moreover, because private arbitration does not involve the use of a judge and a courtroom, later relitigation does not undermine judicial economy by requiring duplication of judicial resources to decide the same issue. Finally, when collateral estoppel is invoked by a <i>nonparty</i> to the private arbitration, the doctrine does not serve the policy against harassment by vexatious litigation. In such cases, the doctrine is asserted not to protect one who has already once prevailed against the same opponent on the same cause of action, but simply to gain vicarious advantage from a litigation victory <i>won by another.</i></p>\n<p>We therefore face a situation in which the policies underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel must yield to the contractual basis of private arbitration, i.e., the principle that the scope and effect of the arbitration are for the parties themselves to decide. Accordingly, we are compelled to conclude that a private arbitration award, even if judicially confirmed, can have no collateral estoppel effect in favor of third persons unless the arbitral parties agreed, in the particular case, that such a consequence should apply.</p>\n<p>We realize that some commentators, and most other courts addressing the issue, have taken a contrary approach. The predominant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> view is that unless the arbitral parties agreed otherwise, a judicially confirmed private arbitration award will have collateral estoppel effect, even in favor of nonparties to the arbitration, if the arbitrator actually and necessarily decided the issue sought to be foreclosed and the party against whom estoppel is invoked had full incentive and opportunity to litigate the matter.

To determine whether particular arbitration proceedings provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate, courts typically proceed case-by-case, assessing multiple factors including the extent to which the arbitration resembled a court trial. (Motomura, <i>Arbitration and Collateral Estoppel: Using Preclusion to Shape Procedural Choices</i> (1988) 63 Tulane L.Rev. 29, 32-36, 52-53 (Motomura) &amp; cases cited; see, e.g., <i>Clemens, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span>, 561 [nature of forum, importance of claim in arbitration, incentive to litigate, extent of actual litigation].)</p>\n<p>When justification for these rules is offered, it centers on one or more of three premises. The first is the general policy against relitigation of issues already decided. (E.g., <i>Messinger, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2583596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2583596/matter-of-am-ins-co-messinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></span>, 803.) The second is that collateral estoppel causes no injustice when the party to be bound had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues to be foreclosed. The third, and most sophisticated, is that \"final\" and \"binding\" arbitration necessarily implies the possibility of collateral estoppel, particularly when (as in California) the law gives judicially confirmed arbitration awards the force and effect of civil judgments. (See, e.g., <i>Witkowski supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763109\"><a href=\"/opinion/763109/joseph-a-witkowski-md-grace-witkowski-joseph-a-witkowski-md-pc/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 199-200 [arbitration award confirmed by federal district court is \"final judgment\" on the merits under FAA which can have issue preclusive effect under Pennsylvania law]; <i>Kaldveer, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160088/western-indus-v-kaldveer-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160088/western-indus-v-kaldveer-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1051 [Idaho's version of Uniform Arbitration Act provides that confirmed arbitration award shall be enforced as any other judgment or decree].)</p>\n<p>Respectfully, we find these rationales unpersuasive. As our earlier discussion suggests, we believe they give insufficient consideration and weight to the voluntary, contractual, and informal nature of private arbitration, and to the consequent reasonable expectations of the arbitral parties.</p>\n<p>In particular, we reject the notion, strongly urged by the concurring and dissenting opinion, that California's statutory provision giving confirmed private arbitration awards the force and effect of civil judgments (see Code Civ. Proc, \u00a7 1287.4)<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> automatically implies that such awards \"may have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect <i>with or without</i> the [specific] consent of the arbitral parties.\" (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J., <i>post,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 385, 982 P.2d at p. 246, italics in original.) Under California law, collateral estoppel will apply in any setting <i>only</i> where such application comports with fairness and sound public policy. (<i>Lucido, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In keeping with that principle, <i>Sanderson, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1424966\"><a href=\"/opinion/1424966/sanderson-v-niemann/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></span>, denied collateral estoppel effect to issues decided by a final judgment of the small claims court.</p>\n<p>As we have indicated, California's private arbitration statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 1287.4, do not warn parties who choose arbitration over court litigation that the arbitrator's award may be used against them by third persons to resolve different causes of action. The contractual nature of private arbitration dictates that the scope and effect of an arbitral award must derive from the parties' consent. Yet the informal nature of arbitration, the usual reasons for its use, the potentially disproportionate consequences of nonmutual collateral estoppel, and the fact that such consequences may not be immediately apparent to the arbitral parties, all suggest that their silence on the subject does not imply consent. Fairness and public policy thus counsel against application of nonmutual collateral estoppel in this setting, unless the parties specifically agree thereto. That California law treats confirmed arbitration awards as judgments does not compel us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we believe the case-by-case approach prevalent in other jurisdictions has particular adverse effects on the choice, use, and effectiveness of private arbitration as a faster, cheaper alternative to litigation in court. Under the prevailing rule, parties who agree to arbitrate, but neglect or fail to negotiate a specific disclaimer of collateral estoppel effect, cannot know in advance whether a court may later find the arbitration binding in favor of third parties on different claims. If the issue ever arises in future litigation, its resolution will depend on a judicial opinion whether the prior arbitration afforded the losing party a full and fair opportunity to litigate the matter to be foreclosed.</p>\n<p>This \"ad hoc, post hoc\" standard eliminates a prime benefit of choosing the arbitral over the judicial forum\u0097the right to shape, control, know, and predict <i>at the outset</i> the scope and effect of the arbitrator's decision. Moreover, the case-by-case approach encourages both the arbitral parties, and the arbitrator himself, to \"hedge\" against the future possibility that the decision will be deemed binding in different litigation with other parties. \"By creating the possibility that some arbitral findings will [have] collateral estoppel [effect], the case-by-case approach puts subtle but strong pressure on the arbitration process to conform its perspective and methods to those of litigation, in order to justify the confidence in its findings that collateral estoppel represents. [A] compelling reason to abandon the case-by-case approach to arbitral collateral estoppel is to case or eliminate this pressure, in order to maintain arbitration as a useful, distinct alternative to litigation.\" (Motomura, <i>supra,</i> 63 Tulane L.Rev. 29, 71.)<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> Accordingly, we adopt, for California purposes, the rule that a private arbitration award cannot have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect unless the arbitral parties so agree. It remains to apply this rule to the facts before us.</p>\n<p>We note first that neither USF &amp; G nor Centennial was a party to the arbitration between Vandenberg and Boyd.<sup>[11]</sup> Moreover, policyholder Vandenberg's current insurance coverage claims against USF &amp; G and Centennial are entirely distinct from the breach of lease claims decided in favor of lessor Boyd, and against lessee Vandenberg, in the Boyd-Vandenberg arbitration. Hence, USF &amp; G and Centennial seek to give the arbitrator's decision nonmutual collateral estoppel effect against Vandenberg. They may not do so unless Vandenberg and Boyd so agreed.</p>\n<p>We find no such agreement. On the contrary, the terms of the three-way settlement among Boyd, Vandenberg, and USF &amp; G strongly suggest the parties' intent that, while the arbitration would be \"binding\" between Vandenberg and Boyd, it should <i>not</i> have collateral estoppel effect in favor of Vandenberg's insurers. Under the express provisions of the settlement, some of Boyd's causes of action against Vandenberg would be dismissed; the remaining, or \"reserved,\" claims <i>in the Boyd action</i> would be decided by \"binding\" arbitration; Boyd and Vandenberg would release certain potential causes of action against USF &amp; G; and USF &amp; G would provide Vandenberg a defense in the Boyd action under a \"full reservation of rights\"; while <i>\"all questions</i> regarding <i>ultimate coverage and indemnity obligations between USF &amp; G and ... Vandenberg ... [were] reserved for resolution.\"</i> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>The clear import of these provisions is that the arbitration would finally resolve the Boyd action, but that ancillary insurance issues between Vandenberg and USF &amp; G, aside from those issues specifically addressed in the settlement, would be unaffected. Under the settlement's terms, <i>both</i> Vandenberg and USF &amp; G retained the right, in future litigation between them, to address de novo \"all questions\" pertinent to USF &amp; G's \"coverage and indemnity obligations.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> Though Centennial was not a party to the settlement, there is no basis to infer that the parties intended or agreed the arbitrator's decision would have broader effect in Centennial's favor than it would have in USF &amp; G's. Accordingly, we conclude there was no agreement by the arbitral parties allowing Vandenberg's insurers to assert, against Vandenberg, the collateral estoppel effect of issues decided in the Boyd-Vandenberg arbitration.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal therefore correctly reversed the trial court order granting the motion of USF &amp; G and Centennial for summary adjudication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The CGL insurance policies issued by all the insurers in this case provided coverage for sums Vandenberg was legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage. We next consider whether this coverage language in a CGL insurance policy necessarily precludes coverage for losses pleaded as contractual damages.</p>\n<p>In holding that coverage for property damage losses is not necessarily precluded because they are pled as contractual damages, the Court of Appeal properly focused on the property itself and the nature of the risk causing the injury. Acknowledging the line of decisions espousing a general rule of noncoverage for contractual damages, the Court of Appeal nevertheless concluded \"the general rule is not a universal bar to insurance coverage whenever a contract is involved. Rather, the focus of coverage for property damage is the property itself. (<i>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc.</i> [ (1995) ] 11 Cal.4th [1,] 17 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, as the Court of Appeal stated, determination of coverage must be made individually by considering \"the nature of [the] property, the injury, and the risk that caused the injury, in light of the particular provisions of each applicable insurance policy.\"</p>\n<p>The insurers contend CGL insurance policies limiting coverage to amounts the insured is \"legally obligated to pay as damages,\" or using similar language, refer to tort liability and not contractual liability. A long line of decisions supports their position, holding that any liability arising ex contractu, as opposed to ex delicto, is not covered under such policies.<sup>[12]</sup> The underlying reasoning of these cases is that the phrase \"legally obligated to Pay as damages\" describes liability based upon a breach of a duty imposed by law, i.e., tort, rather than by contract. (See <i>Wilmington, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284416/wilmington-liquid-bulk-v-somerset-marine/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>We disagree. The nature of the damage and the risk involved, in light of particular policy provisions, control coverage. Moreover, we reject the ex contractu/ex delicto <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> distinction, which derives from a misreading of the seminal case, <i>Ritchie v. Anchor Casualty Co.</i> (1955) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384062/ritchie-v-anchor-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In <i>Ritchie,</i> the court analyzed whether the term \"liability imposed by law,\" the precursor to \"legally obligated to pay,\" included coverage for liability arising from contract. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 254, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span>.) This phrase had usually been construed to mean liability imposed in a definite sum by a final judgment against the assured. (<i>Ibid.</i>) But the policy before the <i>Ritchie</i> court contained a distinction; coverage A applied to \"`liability imposed ... by law or by written contract,'\" whereas coverage B applied to \"`liability imposed ... by law.'\" (<i>Ibid.</i>) The court concluded that the omission of the term \"`or by written contract'\" in coverage B, the portion at issue in <i>Ritchie,</i> \"is persuasive that the phrase `imposed upon him by law' as <i>used in this policy</i>... relates to the nature of the liability to be defended rather than the result of the lawsuit....\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> italics added.)</p>\n<p>In <i>International Surplus, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155622\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155622/intl-surplus-lines-ins-v-devonshire-coverage/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, the phrase at issue was \"`legally obligated to pay as damages,'\" which the court found synonymous with \"`damages for a liability imposed by law,'\" the coverage language in the <i>Ritchie</i> case. Without further discussion, the court then held that the \"latter phrase has been <i>uniformly</i> interpreted as referring to a liability arising ex delicto as distinguished from ex contractu.\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> citing <i>Ritchie, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384062/ritchie-v-anchor-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This brief statement led to a string of cases relying upon <i>International Surplus</i> for the purported distinction between tort and contract damages. These later cases fail to consider, however, the particular and explicit coverage language before the <i>Ritchie</i> court, and thus create an arbitrary distinction that ignores otherwise settled principles of insurance contract interpretation.</p>\n<p>Insurance policies are contracts construed in accordance with the parties' mutual intent at the time of contract formation, as inferred from the written provisions. (Civ.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1639; <i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 666, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The \"clear and explicit\" meaning of the provisions, interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,\" controls judicial interpretation unless \"used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\" (Civ.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1638, 1644.) If the meaning a layperson would ascribe to insurance contract language is not ambiguous, courts will apply that meaning. (<i>AIU Ins. Co. v.

(See <i>AIU, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 825, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Whatever ambiguity a phrase possesses due to a party's legal knowledge is resolved in favor of coverage. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 825, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In <i>AIU,</i> we rejected the claim of noncoverage based upon the fact that the forms of relief sought against the insured by third party suits were equitable and therefore the insured was not legally obligated to pay under the terms of the insurance policy. \"Because California has generally abandoned the traditional distinction between courts of equity and courts of law [citations], even a legally sophisticated policyholder might not anticipate that the term `legally obligated' precludes coverage of equitably compelled expenses.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>Nothing in the respective policies between Vandenberg and any of the insurers suggests any special or legalistic meaning to the phrase \"legally obligated to pay as damages.\" A reasonable layperson would certainly understand \"legally obligated to pay\" to refer to any obligation which is binding and enforceable under the law, whether pursuant to contract or tort liability. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> Further, a reasonable layperson, cognizant that he or she is purchasing a \"general liability\" insurance policy, would not conclude such coverage term only refers to liability pled in tort, and thus entirely excludes liability pled on a theory of breach of contract. Under general insurance principles, we must interpret the phrase \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" in accordance with the ordinary and popular sense, not the legalistic, and erroneously premised, interpretation of the language urged by insurers.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the arbitrariness of the distinction between contract and tort in the <i>International Surplus</i> line of cases is evident when we consider the same act may constitute both a breach of contract and a tort. (See <i>Eads v. Marks</i> (1952) 39 Cal.2d 807,809-811, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span>.) Predicating coverage upon an injured party's choice of remedy or the form of action sought is not the law of this state. (See <i>AIU, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 824-825, Cal.Rptr. 820, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1253</span></a></span>.) The <i>International Surplus</i> rule would thus permit the injured third party to determine insurance coverage. Instead, courts must focus on the nature of the risk and the injury, in light of the policy provisions, to make that determination. In <i>AIU,</i> for example, in rejecting a \"form of remedy\" approach for a determination of coverage, we focused on the nature of the injury and the specific policy language to decide whether there was coverage under the general liability policy for cleanup and other response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.) and related state and federal laws.

It is directed at Clvil liability [which] can arise from either unintentional (negligent) or intentional tort, under common law' statute' or contract.\" (Malecki &amp; Flitner' Commercial General Liability (6th ed.1997) p. 6, italics added) \"The coverage agreement [which] embraces `a11 sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages....' ... is intentionally broad enough to include the insured's obligation to Pay damages for breach of contract as wel1 as for tort, within limitations imposed by other terms of the coverage agreement (e.g. bodily injury and property damage as defined, caused by an occurrence) and by the exclusions....' (Tinker, <i>Comprehensive General Liability Insurance-Perspective and Overview</i> (1975) 25 Fed. Ins.

This language is clear and unambiguous: confirmed arbitration awards are equivalent <i>in all respects</i> to other court judgments.

As we noted just one month ago, the separation of powers doctrine requires that we \"limit ourselves to interpreting the law as written and leave for the ... Legislature the task of revising it as [it] deem[s] wise.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427973/people-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Today, the majority unblushingly ignores our earlier pronouncement and usurps the role of the Legislature by <i>enacting</i> a consent exception to section 1287.4. This judicial enactment, however, cannot be reconciled with the clear and unambiguous language of section 1287.4 or the overall statutory scheme governing arbitrations.</p>\n<p>The majority does engage in a lengthy and tortuous discussion in an attempt to justify its ad hoc revisions to section 1287.4. The discussion, however, is riddled with logical inconsistencies. On the one hand, the majority acknowledges that the Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing arbitration. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at pp. 375-376, 982 P.2d at pp. 237-238.) On the other hand, the majority relegates the text of section 1287.4 to a footnote and dismisses it without even addressing its language. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at pp. 379, 380, fn. 9, 982 P.2d at p. 240.) The majority also acknowledges that the arbitration statutes define the basic characteristics and effect of arbitration proceedings and apply \"even absent the specific agreement of the parties.\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 376, 982 P.2d at p. 238.) Yet, in the same breath, the majority concludes that parties must specifically agree <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> to the application of nonmutual collateral estoppel even though section 1287.4 makes no mention of any such requirement. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 380, 982 P.2d at p. 241.) Finally, the majority inexplicably concludes that the parties in this case did not intend to give the arbitration award collateral estoppel effect despite their massive expenditure of time and resources in the arbitral proceedings. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at pp. 373, 381, 982 P.2d at pp. 235, 243.)</p>\n<p>The majority's use of public policy considerations to circumvent section 1287.4 is just as specious. This case does not present a question of common law policy; it presents a question of statutory interpretation. The court is not at liberty to reject the plain meaning of a statute merely because it believes the statute implements an unwise policy.</p>\n<p>In any event, most of the cited public policy considerations actually repudiate the majority's position. Notwithstanding the majority's conclusory statements to the contrary, its decision today undermines public confidence in the judicial system. First, denying judicially confirmed arbitration awards collateral estoppel effect creates the risk of inconsistent rulings. (See <i>Lucido v. Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because the Legislature has given these arbitration awards \"equal status\" to court judgments, any inconsistencies between the rulings of the arbitrator and court would have a profoundly negative impact on the integrity of our judicial system. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606162/lucido-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Such a result not only contravenes well-established precedents (see, e.g., <i>People v. Sims</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1165575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1165575/people-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 479, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1165575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1165575/people-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Trans Globe Travel Bureau, Inc.</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155231\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155231/kelly-v-trans-globe-travel-bureau-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span>), but also threatens the integrity of judicial decisions. Because individual litigants often have little choice when entering into arbitration agreements, binding these individuals to rulings made without a full and fair opportunity to litigate creates an unavoidable perception of unfairness.</p>\n<p>Denying judicially confirmed arbitrations collateral estoppel effect also undermines judicial economy. The majority correctly recognizes that private arbitrations do not waste judicial resources because they do not involve \"the use of a judge and a courtroom.\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal. Rptr.2d at p. 378, 982 P.2d at p. 239.) Indeed, the Legislature enacted the arbitration statutes in order to provide a viable alternative to the courts. (See <i>Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span> (<i>Moncharsh</i>).) This, however, does not support the conclusion that later relitigation has no effect on judicial economy. If arbitration awards have collateral estoppel effect, relitigation\u0097including additional discovery, motions and trials\u0097would not be necessary. Thus, courts could avoid this needless dissipation of judicial resources by deciding just <i>one</i> motion addressing the collateral estoppel effect of the award.</p>\n<p>Finally, in perhaps the greatest irony of all, the majority's foray into legislative enactment will likely have the very \"adverse effects\" on arbitrations that it seeks to prevent. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 380, 982 P.2d at p. 241.) As an initial matter, the majority's conclusion that the pressure to conform the arbitral process to the litigation process will discourage the use of arbitrations is suspect. Even if arbitrations become more like litigation, they still have several inherent advantages, including' greater limits on discovery, more flexible hearing and trial dates, limited judicial review and the ability to choose arbitrators with expertise in the type of controversy at issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> Instead, the majority decision may also make many commercial disputes inarbitrable or encourage procedural gamesmanship. Commercial disputes often involve nonparties to the arbitration agreement. If the majority is correct and tactical considerations weigh against agreements according nonmutual collateral estoppel effect to a judicially confirmed arbitration award, then the guaranteed \"possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact\" in disputes involving nonparties will lead to two probable outcomes. (Code Civ. Proc, \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (c).) Courts will either deny or stay arbitration or order arbitration and stay the action against nonparties to the arbitration agreement. (<i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135091/mercury-ins-group-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 347-348, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135091/mercury-ins-group-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The first outcome makes otherwise arbitrable disputes inarbitrable in direct contravention of the strong public policy in favor of arbitration. (See <i>Moncharsh, supra,</i> 3 Cal.4th at p. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182211\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182211/moncharsh-v-heily-blase/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The second outcome gives a party asserting claims against nonarbitrating parties an undeserved second bite at the apple if they are not satisfied with the arbitration award. We have already rejected similar forms of \"procedural gamesmanship\" where a party attempts to combine litigation and arbitration in order to obtain an unfair advantage. (<i>Christensen v. Dewor Developments</i> (1983) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1178100\"><a href=\"/opinion/1178100/christensen-v-dewor-developments/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 784, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1178100\"><a href=\"/opinion/1178100/christensen-v-dewor-developments/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, the majority's decision, at best, would have the same effect on arbitrations as the case-by-case approach that it rejects.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I believe the only reasoned view is to determine the applicability of collateral estoppel on a case-by-case basis. If the parties have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in arbitration, then a judicially confirmed arbitration award has nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. If the parties do not, then the award does not have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. By rejecting this approach, the majority ignores the plain language of section 1287.4, the overall statutory scheme governing arbitrations in California and the clear weight of authority \u0097 including the decisions of our sister states with similar statutes,<sup>[1]</sup> the Restatement of Judgments,<sup>[2]</sup> and most commentators and treatises.<sup>[3]</sup> In doing so, the majority sends a clear message to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> the Legislature\u0097\"judicial hostility\" to arbitration still trumps.

Kaiser</i> 1178.) <i>Foundation Hospitals</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251628\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251628/madden-v-kaiser-foundation-hospitals/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span>, 707, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251628\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251628/madden-v-kaiser-foundation-hospitals/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We also do not address the circumstances, if any, in which a private arbitration award may have \"issue preclusive\" effect in subsequent litigation between the <i>same parties</i> on different causes of action. No party has suggested the arbitration here at issue is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a71-14) (FAA), and we have no occasion to consider whether application of the FAA would alter our ruling. We are not concerned with the collateral estoppel implications of arbitrations conducted pursuant to collective bargaining agreements within the purview of federal or slate labor relations laws (see, e.g., <i>Kelly v.

Eugene died during the course of the litigation of their complaint. We shall refer to their interests by the singular Boyd.</p>\n<p>[5]  The settlement agreement does not appear in the record as a signed contract. Instead, the record reflects that the terms of the settlement, including its arbitration provisions, were read in open court by USF &amp; G's counsel, after which the court questioned the individual parties to ascertain their understanding and assent. (See Code Civ. Proc, \u00a7 664.6.)</p>\n<p>[6]  Vandenberg sought clarification that the absence of a pollution exclusion in the policies of Continental, Phoenix and Glens Falls prevented their attempted joinder in Centennial's motion based on collateral estoppel. The trial court did not expressly rule on this request.</p>\n<p>[7]  At all court levels, the parties have focused on whether fairness permits the collateral estoppel use of confirmed contractual arbitration awards. The briefs do not address what significance should attach to the arbitral parties' <i>agreement</i> or <i>failure to agree</i> that their arbitration should have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. In response to a question at oral argument, counsel for USF &amp; G suggested that specific agreement on the issue was irrelevant. But our ruling that contractual arbitration awards may never have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect unless the arbitral parties so agree can produce no unfair surprise. As noted above, the Court of Appeal reached exactly that conclusion.</p>\n<p>[8]  Though, as noted above (see fn. 5, <i>ante</i>), the arbitration agreement in this case was formalized in open court, rather than by an executed writing, no party has suggested the agreement is exempt from California's private contractual arbitration statutes because there was no \"written agreement.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  As amended in 1998, section 1287.4 provides: \"If [a private arbitration] award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that by leaving the nonmutual collateral estoppel effect of a private arbitration award to the agreement of the arbitral parties themselves, we enhance the dangers of inconsistent arbitral and judicial rulings, improperly hinder the arbitration of arbitrable disputes, encourage \"procedural gamesmanship\" (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J., <i>post,</i> 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 387, 982 P.2d at p. 248), and offer arbitral parties unfair \"second bite[s] at the apple\" (<i>ibid.</i>), particularly in complex cases where arbitrable disputes are closely related to broader litigation that includes arbitral nonparties. But as the concurring and dissenting opinion effectively concedes (and at least where, as here, the arbitration agreement is governed exclusively by California law), this slate's arbitration statutes give courts specific and ample means of assuring that private arbitrations will not impact unfairly on judicial decisionmaking, or on third party rights, when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a litigant against a third person in closely related court proceedings involving \"a common issue of law or fact.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (c) (\u00a7 1281.2(c)) [court may deny arbitration, impose forced joinder of some or all parties or issues in a single proceeding, and use stay power to determine whether arbitration or court litigation will proceed first]; cf. <i>Volt Info.

But the concerns raised by the concurring and dissenting opinion \u0097 many speculative in the extreme \u0097 do not justify imposing such a consequence in the absence of the arbitral parties' consent.</p>\n<p>[11]  Although not a party to the Boyd action, USF &amp; G, in its capacity as Vandenberg's liability insurer, did participate in the settlement agreement that led to the Boyd/Vandenberg arbitration. As part of that agreement, USF &amp; G provided Vandenberg's legal defense in the arbitration. This does not mean, however, that USF &amp; G was a party to the arbitration itself. USF &amp; G's legal relationship to the Boyd/Vandenberg arbitration was the same as it would have been to a court trial between those parties.</p>\n<p>[12]  (See <i>Old Republic Ins. Co. v.

First, we must consider when, if ever, a judicially confirmed award in an arbitration governed by California\u2019s private arbitration law (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.) is entitled to collateral estoppel, or \u201cissue preclusion,\u201d effect in favor of a <em>nonparty </em>to the arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, we must determine whether a commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policy that provides coverage for sums the insured is \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d may cover losses arising from a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">We reach the following conclusions: First, a private arbitration award, even if judicially confirmed, may not have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect under California law unless there was an agreement to that effect in the particular case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the coverage phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages,\u201d as used in a CGL insurance policy, may provide an insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>defendant with coverage for losses pleaded as contractual damages. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The underlying litigation involves damage to a parcel of land that Vandenberg<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> used as an automobile sales and service facility. Before 1958, owners Eugene and Kathryn Boyd<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> operated an automobile dealership on the property. From 1958 to 1988, Vandenberg leased the property from Boyd under a series of leases. In 1988 Vandenberg discontinued the business and possession of the land reverted to Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">To prepare the property for sale, Boyd removed three underground waste oil storage tanks. Testing revealed contamination of soils and groundwater underlying the property. Boyd filed an action against Vandenberg, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of gpod faith and fair dealing, public and private nuisance, negligence, waste, trespass, strict liability, equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The Boyd complaint alleged Vandenberg had installed and operated the waste oil storage tanks and the tanks were the source of the petroleum contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Vandenberg had obtained CGL insurance from several companies over the years, including Phoenix Assurance Company of New York (Phoenix), the Glens Falls Insurance Company (Glens Falls), Continental Insurance Company (Continental), TIG Insurance Corporation, Centennial Insurance Company (Centennial), and United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G) (collectively insurers). The policies provided coverage to Vandenberg for sums he was \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d because of property damage. However, certain of the policies, including policies issued by USF&amp;G and Centennial, also contained a so-called pollution exclusion, under which property damage caused by a pollutant or contaminant was not covered except for a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Vandenberg tendered defense of the Boyd action to his insurers, but only USF&amp;G agreed to provide a defense. During judicially supervised settlement proceedings, Vandenberg, Boyd, and USF&amp;G reached an agreement among themselves to resolve the Boyd litigation. The agreement provided that its parties would contribute jointly to the investigation and remediation of the contamination, with USF&amp;G bearing the largest share of the cost. Boyd agreed to release USF&amp;G from any claims. Vandenberg agreed to release USF&amp;G from claims for bad faith, breach of the contract, and extracontractual damages. Boyd released all claims against Vandenberg except those based on the theory that the contamination constituted a breach of the lease agreements. <em>Boyd and Vandenberg </em>agreed to resolve the reserved <em>breach of lease </em>issues through arbitration or by trial, depending upon their agreement on an arbitrator and arbitration schedule. Vandenberg conditioned his agreement to the settlement upon the arbitration being \u201cbinding.\u201d USF&amp;G agreed to defend Vandenberg, but the ultimate issues of USF&amp;G\u2019s coverage and indemnity obligations, as well as any claim by Vandenberg for <em>Cumis </em>counsel fees (see <em>San Diego Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Cumis Ins. Society, Inc. </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 358, 375 [208 Cal.Rptr. 494, 50 A.L.R.4th 913]), were <em>\u201creserved for </em>[future] resolution.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The arbitration between Vandenberg and Boyd took place before a retired federal judge, Raul Ramirez. Formal discovery was conducted, and the transcribed proceedings included representation by counsel, and extensive evidence, briefing, and argument. In a lengthy and detailed decision, the arbitrator ruled for Boyd. Among other things, the arbitrator found that the contamination stemmed primarily from the underground waste oil tanks and was caused in part by Vandenberg\u2019s improper installation, maintenance and use of the tanks. The arbitrator indicated the discharge of contaminants was not sudden and accidental. The arbitrator\u2019s award of over $4 million to Boyd was confirmed by a superior court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The insurers rejected Vandenberg\u2019s request for indemnification. He then filed the underlying action against his insurers, alleging various causes of action arising out of the failure to defend, settle, or indemnify in the Boyd action.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The insurers filed two motions for summary adjudication. In the first motion, Centennial and USF&amp;G argued they had no duty to defend or indemnify because the pollution exclusion in their policies was triggered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the arbitrator\u2019s determination in the Boyd action that the contamination was not sudden and accidental. These two insurers contended that Vandenberg\u2019s relitigation of the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d issue was precluded by principles of collateral estoppel. In the second motion, all insurers sought summary adjudication on the basis that the arbitrator awarded damages for breach of lease, a contractual cause of action, and contractual damages are not covered by the CGL insurance policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The trial court granted both motions for summary adjudication. As to the first motion, the trial court ruled that relitigation of issues regarding the source and causation of the contamination was precluded by collateral estoppel. The court reviewed the arbitration transcript and concluded the \u201conly reasonable inference is that the leaks or spills were occurring over a considerable period of time.\u201d The court found, under <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815], that Vandenberg had no factual basis to contend the sudden and accidental exception to the pollution exclusion in Centennial and USF&amp;G\u2019s policies applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the second motion, the trial court found Vandenberg had no coverage under the policies for the arbitration award because the claims submitted to the arbitrator were contractual.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">After consolidating the cases, the Court of Appeal issued peremptory writs of mandate reversing both summary adjudication orders. The appellate court first held that, absent a contrary agreement by the arbitral parties, a party to private arbitration is not barred from relitigating issues decided by the arbitrator when those issues arise in a different case involving a different adversary and different causes of action. It would not be fair to give a private arbitration decision nonmutual collateral estoppel effect without the arbitral parties\u2019 consent, the Court of Appeal reasoned, because private arbitration lacks significant safeguards of court litigation, particularly the right to full judicial review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal also ruled that coverage under the insurance policies in question could not be determined by reference to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that damages for an insured\u2019s nonperformance of a contract are not covered under CGL insurance policies. (See <em>International Surplus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>Lines Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Coverage Corp. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 601, 610-611 [155 Cal.Rptr. 870] <em>(International Surplus).) </em>Rather, the court reasoned, when there is damage to property, the focus of the inquiry should be the nature of the risk or peril that caused the injury and the specific policy language, not the form of action brought by the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">We granted the insurers\u2019 petitions for review to consider the circumstances, if any, in which private contractual arbitration decisions may have collateral estoppel effect in favor of nonparties, and whether CGL policy language indicating coverage for sums the insured becomes \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d can include losses pled as breach of contract. We consider each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Collateral estoppel is one of two aspects of the doctrine of res judicata. In its narrowest form, res judicata \u201c \u2018precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a <em>cause of action </em>[finally resolved in a prior proceeding].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601, 604 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439] <em>(Teitelbaum Furs), </em>quoting <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 810 [122 P.2d 892] <em>(Bernhard).) </em>But res judicata also includes a broader principle, commonly termed collateral estoppel, under which an <em>issue </em>\u201c \u2018necessarily decided in [prior] litigation [may be] conclusively determined <em>as </em>[against] <em>the parties </em>[thereto] <em>or their privies . . . </em>in a subsequent lawsuit on a <em>different </em>cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Teitelbaum Furs, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 604, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Thus, res judicata does not merely bar relitigation of identical claims or causes of action. Instead, in its collateral estoppel aspect, the doctrine may also preclude a party to prior litigation from redisputing <em>issues </em>therein decided against him, even when those issues bear on different claims raised in a later case. Moreover, because the estoppel need not be mutual, it is not necessary that the earlier and later proceedings involve the identical parties or their privies. Only the party <em>against whom </em>the doctrine is invoked must be bound by the prior proceeding. <em>(Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223, 2 A.L.R.5th 995] <em>(Lucido); Teitelbaum Furs, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 601, 604; <em>Bernhard, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 807, 810-813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Accordingly, the collateral estoppel doctrine may allow one who was not a party to prior litigation to take advantage, in a later unrelated matter, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>findings made against his current adversary in the earlier proceeding. This means that the loss of a particular dispute against a particular opponent in a particular forum may impose adverse and unforeseeable litigation consequences far beyond the parameters of the original case. (See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Trans Globe Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 195, 202 [131 Cal.Rptr. 488] <em>(Kelly).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Collateral estoppel (like the narrower \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d aspect of res judicata) is intended to preserve the integrity of the judicial system, promote judicial economy, and protect litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation. <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 335, 343.) However, even where the minimal prerequisites for invocation of the doctrine are present, collateral estoppel \u201c \u2018is not an inflexible, universally applicable principle; policy considerations may limit its use where the . . . underpinnings of the doctrine are outweighed by other factors.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 596, 603 [172 Cal.Rptr. 826]; see also <em>Kelly, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Whether collateral estoppel is fair and consistent with public policy in a particular case depends in part upon the character of the forum that first decided the issue later sought to be foreclosed. In this regard, courts consider the judicial nature of the prior forum, i.e., its legal formality, the scope of its jurisdiction, and its procedural safeguards, particularly including the opportunity for judicial review of adverse rulings.

An independent purpose of modem private arbitration statutes is to overcome earlier judicial hostility to arbitration agreements, and to ensure that such agreements, like other legally valid contracts, are enforced in accordance with their terms. <em>(Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 213, 219-221 [105 S.Ct. 1238, 1241-1243, 84 L.Ed.2d 158] [discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>similar contemporaneously enacted provisions of FAA].) Accordingly, policies favoring the efficiency of private arbitration as a means of dispute resolution must sometimes yield to its fundamentally contractual nature, and to the attendant requirement that arbitration shall proceed <em>as the parties themselves have agreed. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Of course, the parties to a private arbitration need not, and sometimes may not, specify every detail, characteristic, and consequence of the proceeding they contemplate. As indicated above, the California statutes set forth certain basic, common characteristics of such proceedings, including their general relationship to the judicial system, that will apply even absent the specific agreement of the parties. These include, among others, the limited grounds and procedures for judicial review of a private arbitration award. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1286.2, 1286.6; <em>Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, 8-33 [finding statutory grounds for judicial review exclusive].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Limited judicial review is a well-understood feature of private arbitration, inherent in the nature of the arbitral forum as an informal, expeditious, and efficient alternative means of dispute resolution. By choosing private arbitration, the parties \u201cevince [their] intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels.\u201d <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, 10.) Judicial interference with the arbitrator\u2019s decision would thus defeat the very advantages the arbitral parties sought to achieve. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Accordingly, the parties, simply by agreeing to arbitrate, are deemed to accept limited judicial review <em>by implication, </em>particularly where their agreement specified that the award would be \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d upon them. <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th. 1, 9-10.) In effect, it is appropriate to insulate a private arbitral award from close judicial scrutiny because, given the inherent nature of arbitration, <em>\u201cthe parties have agreed that it be so.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 10, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">However, very different considerations affect the issue whether private arbitration awards should have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. California\u2019s statutory scheme nowhere specifies that, despite the arbitral parties\u2019 failure so to agree, a private arbitration award may be binding in favor of <em>nonparties </em>in litigation involving <em>different </em>causes of action. Moreover, in our view, such a consequence is not an inherent or expected feature of private arbitration that is implicitly accepted by the arbitral parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">As we recently observed, private arbitration is a process in which parties voluntarily trade the safeguards and formalities of court litigation for an expeditious, sometimes roughshod means of resolving their dispute.  The traditional rule is that \u201c \u2018[arbitrators, unless specifically required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>to act in conformity with rules of law, may base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity, and in doing so may expressly or impliedly reject a claim <em>that a party might successfully have asserted in a judicial action.\u2019\u2019 </em>[Citations.] As early as 1852, this court recognized that, \u2018The arbitrators are not bound to award on principles of dry law, but may decide on principles of equity and good conscience, and make their award <em>ex aequo et bono </em>[according to what is just and good].\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018As a consequence, . . . \u201c[p]arties who stipulate in an agreement that controversies . . . shall be settled by arbitration, may expect not only to reap the advantages that flow from the use of that nontechnical, summary procedure, but also to find themselves bound by an award reached by paths neither marked nor traceable and not subject to judicial review.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11, quoting <em>Nogueiro </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1195 [250 Cal.Rptr. 478], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">But while the informal and imprecise nature of private arbitration, and its insulation from judicial interference, are \u201c \u2018the very advantages the . . . parties [seek] to achieve\u2019 \u201d in arbitrating <em>their own claims </em>(see, <em>ante, </em>p. 831, quoting <em>Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, 10), these same features can be serious, unexpected disadvantages if issues decided by the arbitrator are given leveraged effect in favor of strangers to the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">An agreement to arbitrate particular claims reflects each party\u2019s conclusion that the immediate stakes make it preferable to avoid the delay and expense of court proceedings, and instead to resolve the matter between themselves without resort to the judicial process. Under such circumstances, each party is willing to risk that the arbitration will result in a \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d <em>defeat </em>with respect to <em>the submitted claims, </em>even though the party would have won in court, and even though the arbitrator\u2019s errors must be accepted without opportunity for review. (See <em>Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, 10-12.) But this does not mean each arbitral party also consents that issues decided against him by this informal, imprecise method may bind him, in the same manner as a court trial, in <em>all future </em>disputes, <em>regardless </em>of the stakes, against <em>all </em>adversaries, known and unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">On the contrary, common sense weighs against the assumption that parties contemplate such remote and collateral ramifications when they agree to arbitrate controversies between themselves. Logic equally suggests that conscious agreements to give arbitrators\u2019 decisions nonmutual collateral estoppel effect would not be routine. <em>The very fact </em>that arbitration is by nature an informal process, not strictly bound by evidence, law, or judicial oversight, suggests reasonable parties would hesitate to agree that the arbitrator\u2019s findings in their own dispute should thereafter bind them in cases involving different adversaries and claims. Even where, as here, the arbitral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>parties have imposed some formality on their proceedings, have aired their dispute thoroughly, and have received a detailed decision, there is no reason to assume they agreed to \u201cissue preclusive\u201d effect in favor of nonparties. In the usual case, tactical considerations would weigh against such an agreement. Most often, the effect would be to burden whichever party <em>lost </em>the arbitration, while affording no corresponding benefit to either arbitral party. (See Shell, <em>Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel Effects of Commercial Arbitration </em>(1988) 35 UCLA L.Rev. 623, 667.).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Accordingly, there is little basis to surmise that mere silence implies the arbitral parties\u2019 acceptance of nonmutual collateral estoppel. A general rule that confirmed that private arbitation awards may have such effect would thus violate the fundamental premise that private arbitration is a contractual proceeding <em>whose scope and effect are defined and limited by the parties\u2019 consent. </em>For similar reasons, such a rule would chill, rather than promote, the voluntary use of the arbitral forum as an efficient and informal alternative means of resolving particular controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Under these circumstances, the public policy reasons against applying the collateral estoppel doctrine (see, e.g., <em>Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 335, 343; <em>Kelly, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d 195, 202) well outweigh those in favor of doing so. In fact, the traditional justifications for collateral estoppel\u2014factors which \u201cstrongly influence whether its application in a particular circumstance would be fair to the parties and constitute[] sound [public] policy\u201d <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>at p. 343)\u2014have diminished force when the nonmutual prong of the doctrine is applied to private arbitration without the arbitral parties\u2019 specific consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">As noted above, the primary purposes of collateral estoppel are to \u201cpreserv[e] the integrity of the judicial system, promot[e] judicial economy, and protect[] litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation.\u201d <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 335, 343.) But because a private arbitrator\u2019s award is <em>outside </em>the judicial system, denying the award collateral estoppel effect has no adverse impact on judicial integrity. Moreover, because private arbitration does not involve the use of a judge and a courtroom, later relitigation does not undermine judicial economy by requiring duplication of judicial resources to decide the same issue. Finally, when collateral estoppel is invoked by a <em>nonparty </em>to the private arbitration, the doctrine does not serve the policy against harassment by vexatious litigation. In such cases, the doctrine is asserted not to protect one who has already once prevailed against the same opponent on the same cause of action, but simply to gain vicarious advantage from a litigation victory <em>won by another.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">We therefore face a situation in which the policies underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel must yield to the contractual basis of private arbitration, i.e., the principle that the scope and effect of the arbitration are for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>parties themselves to decide. Accordingly, we are compelled to conclude that a private arbitration award, even if judicially confirmed, can have no collateral estoppel effect in favor of third persons unless the arbitral parties agreed, in the particular case, that such a consequence should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We realize that some commentators, and most other courts addressing the issue, have taken a contrary approach. The predominant view is that unless the arbitral parties agreed otherwise, a judicially confirmed private arbitration award will have collateral estoppel effect, even in favor of nonparties to the arbitration, if the arbitrator actually and necessarily decided the .issue sought to be foreclosed and the party against whom estoppel is invoked had full incentive and opportunity to litigate the matter.

To determine whether particular arbitration proceedings provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate, courts typically proceed case by case, assessing multiple factors, including the extent to which the arbitration resembled a court trial. (Motomura, <em>Arbitration and Collateral Estoppel: Using Preclusion to Shape Procedural Choices </em>(1988) 63 Tul. L.Rev. 29, 32-36, 52-53 (Motomura) &amp; cases cited; see, e.g., <em>Clemens, supra, </em>481 N.E.2d 560, 561 [nature of forum, importance of claim in arbitration, incentive to litigate, extent of actual litigation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">When justification for these rules is offered, it centers on one or more of three premises. The first is the general policy against relitigation of issues already decided. (E.g., <em>Messinger, supra, </em>371 N.E.2d 798, 803.) The second is that collateral estoppel causes no injustice when the party to be bound had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues to be foreclosed. The third, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>and most sophisticated, is that \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d arbitration necessarily implies the possibility of collateral estoppel, particularly when (as in California) the law gives judicially confirmed arbitration awards the force and effect of civil judgments. (See, e.g., <em>Witkowski, supra, </em>173 F.3d 192, 199-200 [arbitration award confirmed by federal district court is \u201cfinal judgment\u201d on the merits under FAA which can have issue-preclusive effect under Pennsylvania law]; <em>Kaldveer, supra, </em>887 P.2d 1048, 1051 [Idaho\u2019s version of Uniform Arbitration Act provides that confirmed arbitration award shall be enforced as any other judgment or decree].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Respectfully, we find these rationales unpersuasive. As our earlier discussion suggests, we believe they give insufficient consideration and weight to the voluntary, contractual, and informal nature of private arbitration, and to the consequent reasonable expectations of the arbitral parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In particular, we reject the notion, strongly urged by the concurring and dissenting opinion, that California\u2019s statutory provision giving confirmed private arbitration awards the force and effect of civil judgments (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1287.4)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> automatically implies that such awards \u201cmay have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect <em>with or without </em>the [specific] consent of the arbitral parties.\u201d (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 842, italics in original.) Under California law, collateral estoppel will apply in any setting <em>only </em>where such application comports with fairness and sound public policy. <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 335, 343.) In keeping with that principle, <em>Sanderson, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 563, denied collateral estoppel effect to issues decided by a final judgment of the small claims court.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">As we have indicated, California\u2019s private arbitration statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 1287.4, do not warn parties who choose arbitation over court litigation that the arbitrator\u2019s award may be used against them by third persons to resolve different causes of action. The contractual nature of private arbitration dictates that the scope and effect of an arbitral award must derive from the parties\u2019 consent. Yet the informal nature of arbitration, the usual reasons for its use, the potentially disproportionate consequences of nonmutual collateral estoppel, and the fact that such consequences may not be immediately apparent to the arbitral parties, all suggest that their silence on the subject does not imply consent. Fairness and public policy thus counsel against application of nonmutual collateral estoppel in this setting, unless the parties specifically agree thereto. That California law treats confirmed arbitration awards as judgments does not compel us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Moreover, we believe the case-by-case approach prevalent in other jurisdictions has particular adverse effects on the choice, use, and effectiveness of private arbitration as a faster, cheaper alternative to litigation in court. Under the prevailing rule, parties who agree to arbitrate, but neglect or fail to negotiate a specific disclaimer of collateral estoppel effect, cannot know in advance whether a court may later find the arbitration binding in favor of third parties on different claims. If the issue ever arises in future litigation, its resolution will depend on a judicial opinion whether the prior arbitration afforded the losing party a full and fair opportunity to litigate the matter to be foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">This \u201cad hoc, post hoc\u201d standard eliminates a prime benefit of choosing the arbitral over the judicial forum\u2014the right to shape, control, know, and predict <em>at the outset </em>the scope and effect of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. Moreover, the case-by-case approach encourages both the arbitral parties, and the arbitrator himself, to \u201chedge\u201d against the future possibility that the decision will be deemed binding in different litigation with other parties. \u201cBy creating the possibility that some arbitral findings will [have] collateral estoppel [effect], the case-by-case approach puts subtle but strong pressure on the arbitration process to conform its perspective and methods to those of litigation, in order to justify the confidence in its findings that collateral estoppel represents. [A] compelling reason to abandon the case-by-case approach to arbitral collateral estoppel is to ease or eliminate this pressure, in order to maintain arbitration as a useful, distinct alternative to litigation.\u201d (Motomura, <em>supra, </em>63 Tul. L.Rev. 29, 71.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Accordingly, we adopt, for California purposes, the rule that a private arbitration award cannot have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>arbitral parties so agree.  It remains to apply this rule to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We note first that neither USF&amp;G nor Centennial was a party to the arbitration between Vandenberg and Boyd.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, policyholder Vandenberg\u2019s current insurance coverage claims against USF&amp;G and Centennial are entirely distinct from the breach of lease claims decided in favor of lessor Boyd, and against lessee Vandenberg, in the Boyd/Vandenberg arbitration. Hence, USF&amp;G and Centennial seek to give the arbitrator\u2019s decision nonmutual collateral estoppel effect against Vandenberg. They may not do so unless Vandenberg and Boyd so agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We find no such agreement. On the contrary, the terms of the three-way settlement among Boyd, Vandenberg, and USF&amp;G strongly suggest the parties\u2019 intent that, while the arbitration would be \u201cbinding\u201d between Vandenberg and Boyd, it should <em>not </em>have collateral estoppel effect in favor of Vandenberg\u2019s insurers. Under the express provisions of the settlement, some of Boyd\u2019s causes of action against Vandenberg would be dismissed; the remaining, or \u201creserved,\u201d claims <em>in the Boyd action </em>would be decided by \u201cbinding\u201d arbitration; Boyd and Vandenberg would release certain potential causes of action against USF&amp;G; and USF&amp;G would provide Vandenberg a defense in the Boyd action under a \u201cfull reservation of rights\u201d; while <em>\u201call questions </em>regarding <em>ultimate coverage and indemnity obligations between USF&amp;G and </em>. . . <em>Vandenberg . </em>. . <em>[were] reserved for </em>resolution.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The clear import of these provisions is that the arbitration would finally resolve the Boyd action, but that ancillary insurance issues between Vandenberg and USF&amp;G, aside from those issues specifically addressed in the settlement, would be unaffected. Under the settlement\u2019s terms, <em>both </em>Vandenberg and USF&amp;G retained the right, in future litigation between them, to address de novo \u201call questions\u201d pertinent to USF&amp;G\u2019s \u201ccoverage and indemnity obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Though Centennial was not a party to the settlement, there is no basis to infer that the parties intended or agreed the arbitrator\u2019s decision would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>broader effect in Centennial\u2019s favor than it would have in USF&amp;G\u2019s. Accordingly, we conclude there was no agreement by the arbitral parties allowing Vandenberg\u2019s insurers to assert, against Vandenberg, the collateral estoppel effect of issues decided in the Boyd/Vandenberg arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The Court of Appeal therefore correctly reversed the trial court order granting the motion of USF&amp;G and Centennial for summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The CGL insurance policies issued by all the insurers in this case provided coverage for sums Vandenberg was legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage. We next consider whether this coverage language in a CGL insurance policy necessarily precludes coverage for losses pleaded as contractual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In holding that coverage for property damage losses is not necessarily precluded because they are pled as contractual damages, the Court of Appeal properly focused on the property itself and the nature of the risk causing the injury. Acknowledging the line of decisions espousing a general rule of noncoverage for contractual damages, the Court of Appeal nevertheless concluded \u201cthe general rule is not a universal bar to insurance coverage whenever a contract is involved. Rather, the focus of coverage for property damage is the property itself. <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>[(1995)] 11 Cal.4th [1,] 17 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].)\u201d Coverage under a CGL insurance policy is not based upon the fortuity of the form of action chosen by the injured party. Thus, as the Court of Appeal stated, determination of coverage must be made individually by considering \u201cthe nature of [the] property, the injury, and the risk that caused the injury, in light of the particular provisions of each applicable insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The insurers contend CGL insurance policies limiting coverage to amounts the insured is \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages,\u201d or using similar language, refer to tort liability and not contractual liability. A long line of decisions supports their position, holding that any liability arising ex contractu, as opposed to ex delicto, is not covered under such policies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The underlying reasoning of these cases is that the phrase \u201clegally obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>pay as damages\u201d describes liability based upon a breach of a duty imposed by law, i.e., tort, rather than by contract. (See <em>Wilmington, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 186, 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We disagree. The nature of the damage and the risk involved, in light of particular policy provisions, control coverage. Moreover, we reject the ex contractu/ex delicto distinction, which derives from a misreading of the seminal case, <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Anchor Casualty Co. </em>(1955) 135 Cal.App.2d 245 [286 P.2d 1000] <em>(Ritchie). </em>In <em>Ritchie, </em>the court analyzed whether the term \u201cliability imposed by law,\u201d the precursor to \u201clegally obligated to pay,\u201d included coverage for liability arising from contract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 254.) This phrase had usually been construed to mean liability imposed in a definite sum by a final judgment against the assured. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But the policy before the <em>Ritchie </em>court contained a distinction; coverage A applied to \u201c \u2018liability imposed ... by law or by written contract,\u2019 \u201d whereas coverage B applied to \u201c \u2018liability imposed ... by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that the omission of the term \u201c \u2018or by written contract\u2019 \u201d in coverage B, the portion at issue in <em>Ritchie, </em>\u201cis persuasive that the phrase \u2018imposed upon him by law\u2019 <em>as used in this policy . . . </em>relates to the nature of the liability to be defended rather than the result of the lawsuit . . . .\u201d (Ibid., italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>International Surplus, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 601, 611, the phrase at issue was \u201c \u2018legally obligated to pay as damages,\u2019 \u201d which the court found synonymous with \u201c \u2018damages for a liability imposed by law,\u2019 \u201d the coverage language in the <em>Ritchie </em>case. Without further discussion, the court then held that the \u201clatter phrase has been <em>uniformly </em>interpreted as referring to a liability arising ex delicto as distinguished from ex contractu.\u201d (Ibid., citing <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 245, italics added.) This brief statement led to a string of cases relying upon <em>International Surplus </em>for the purported distinction between tort and contract damages. These later cases fail to consider, however, the particular and explicit coverage language before the <em>Ritchie </em>court, and thus create an arbitrary distinction that ignores otherwise settled principles of insurance contract interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Insurance policies are contracts construed in accordance with the parties\u2019 mutual intent at the time of contract formation, as inferred from the written provisions. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1639; <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Admiral Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 645, 666 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878].) The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of the provisions, interpreted in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d controls judicial interpretation unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1638, 1644.) If the meaning a layperson would ascribe to insurance contract language is not ambiguous, courts will apply that meaning. <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Even if a provision raises doubts as to coverage in the minds of legally trained observers due to a sophisticated legal distinction, courts will not assume the distinction was incorporated into the policy. (See <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 825.) Whatever ambiguity a phrase possesses due to a party\u2019s legal knowledge is resolved in favor of coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 825.) In <em>AIU, </em>we rejected the claim of noncoverage based upon the fact that the forms of relief sought against the insured by third party suits were equitable and therefore the insured was not legally obligated to pay under the terms of the insurance policy. \u201cBecause California has generally abandoned the traditional distinction between courts of equity and courts of law [citations], even a legally sophisticated policyholder might not anticipate that the term \u2018legally obligated\u2019 precludes coverage of equitably compelled expenses.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Nothing in the respective policies between Vandenberg and any of the insurers suggests any special or legalistic meaning to the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages.\u201d A reasonable layperson would certainly understand \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d to refer to any obligation which is binding and enforceable under the law, whether pursuant to contract or tort liability. Further, a reasonable layperson, cognizant that he or she is purchasing a \u201cgeneral liability\u201d insurance policy, would not conclude such coverage term only refers to liability pled in tort, and thus entirely excludes liability pled on a theory of breach of contract. Under general insurance principles, we must interpret the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d in accordance with the ordinary and popular sense, not the legalistic, and erroneously premised, interpretation of the language urged by insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Moreover, the arbitrariness of the distinction between contract and tort in the <em>International Surplus </em>line of cases is evident when we consider the same act may constitute both a breach of contract and a tort. (See <em>Eads </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 807, 809-811 [249 P.2d 257].) Predicating coverage upon an injured party\u2019s choice of remedy or the form of action sought is not the law of this state. (See <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 824-825.) The <em>International Surplus </em>rule would thus permit the injured third party to determine insurance coverage. Instead, courts must focus on the nature of the risk and the injury, in light of the policy provisions, to make that determination. In <em>AIU, </em>for example, in rejecting a \u201cform of remedy\u201d approach for a determination of coverage, we focused on the nature of the injury and the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>policy language to decide whether there was coverage under the general liability policy for cleanup and other response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.) and related state and federal laws. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 819, 824-843; see <em>Haralambos, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 1308, 1317 [entitlement to defense if recovery sought damages for property damage; no property damage and thus, no coverage]; <em>International Surplus, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 601, 611 [insured\u2019s conduct did not result in property damage or personal injury under policy].)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Insurance treatises concur with this approach. \u201c[Wjhether a particular claim falls within the coverage afforded by a liability policy is not affected by the form of the legal proceeding. Accordingly, the legal theory asserted by the claimant is immaterial to the determination of whether the risk is covered.\u201d (9 Couch, Insurance (3d ed. 1997) \u00a7 126:3, p. 126-8.) Insurance commentators explain: \u201cThe expression \u2018legally obligated\u2019 connotes legal responsibility that is <em>broad </em>in scope. It is directed at civil liability .... [which] can arise from either unintentional (negligent) or intentional tort, under common law, statute, or contract.\u201d (Malecki &amp; Flitner, Commercial General Liability (6th ed. 1997) p. 6, italics added.) \u201cThe coverage agreement [which] embraces \u2018all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages is intentionally broad enough to include the insured\u2019s obligation to pay damages for breach of contract as well as for tort, within limitations imposed by other terms of the coverage agreement (e.g. bodily injury and property damage as defined, caused by an occurrence) and by the exclusions . . . .\u201d (Tinker, <em>Comprehensive General Liability Insurance\u2014Perspective and Overview </em>(1975) 25 Fed. Ins. Coun. Q. 217, 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">We therefore conclude that the <em>International Surplus </em>rationale, distinguishing contract from tort liability for purposes of the CGL insurance coverage phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages,\u201d is incorrect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we uphold the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Vandenberg\u2019s insurers cannot avoid coverage for damages awarded against Vandenberg in the Boyd action solely on grounds the damages were assessed on a contractual theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Mosk, Acting C.

Nothing in our decision imposes or implies any limitations on the strict res judicata, or \u201cclaim preclusive,\u201d effect of a California law private arbitration award. (See, e.g., <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Crum </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, 756-761 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 27] [unconfirmed award in private arbitration between homeowner and general contractor is res judicata barring homeowner\u2019s identical claim against subcontractor]; <em>Sartor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 322, 327-328 [187 Cal.Rptr. 247] [confirmed private arbitration award in favor of architectural firm is res judicata barring homeowner\u2019s identical causes of action against firm\u2019s employees].) We also do not address the circumstances, if any, in which a private arbitration award may have \u201cissue preclusive\u201d effect in subsequent litigation between the <em>same parties </em>on different causes of action. No party has suggested the arbitration here at issue is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14) (FAA), and we have no occasion to consider whether application of the FAA would alter our ruling. We are not concerned with the collateral estoppel implications of arbitrations conducted pursuant to collective bargaining agreements within the purview of federal or state labor relations laws (see, e.g., <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Vons Companies, Inc. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1329, 1339-1341 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 763] [union arbitration to enforce collective bargaining agreement held preclusive against union members asserting similar issues in subsequent suit against employer]; but cf. <em>Lehto </em>v. <em>Underground Constr.

Nor do we express views on the collateral estoppel effects of arbitrations conducted under various other California statutory schemes. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1141.10 et seq. [mandatory judicial arbitration of civil actions with low amounts in controversy]; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

In response to a question at oral argument, counsel for USF&amp;G suggested that specific agreement on the issue was irrelevant.

But as the concurring and dissenting opinion effectively concedes (and at least where, as here, the arbitration agreement is governed exclusively by California law), this state\u2019s arbitration statutes give courts specific and ample means of assuring that private arbitrations will not impact unfairly on judicial decisionmaking, or on third party rights, when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a litigant against a third person in closely related court proceedings involving \u201ca common issue of law or fact.\u201d (Code Civ.

Section 1287.4 of the Code of Civil Procedure (section 1287.4) establishes that a confirmed arbitration award has <em>\u201cthe same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, </em>a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) This language is clear and unambiguous: confirmed arbitration awards are equivalent <em>in all respects </em>to other court judgments. Thus, a confirmed arbitration award, like any other judgment, may have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect <em>with or without </em>the express or implied consent of the arbitral parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In accordance with the well-established tenets of statutory construction, our analysis should begin and end here. (See <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299] [\u201cIf the language [of a statute] is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the Legislature . . . .\u201d].) Indeed, we recently refused to disregard or rewrite any part of a statute absent \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cfirm evidence of the drafters\u2019 true intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 6 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829].) As we noted just one month ago, the separation of powers doctrine requires that we \u201climit ourselves to interpreting the law as written and leave for the . . . Legislature the task of revising it as [it] deem[s] wise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.) Today, the majority unblushingly ignores our earlier pronouncement and usurps the role of the Legislature by <em>enacting </em>a consent exception to section 1287.4. This judicial enactment, however, cannot be reconciled with the clear and unambiguous language of section 1287.4 or the overall statutory scheme governing arbitrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The majority does engage in a lengthy and tortuous discussion in an attempt to justify its ad hoc revisions to section 1287.4. The discussion, however, is riddled with logical inconsistencies. On the one hand, the majority acknowledges that the Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing arbitration. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 830.) On the other hand, the majority relegates the text of section 1287.4 to a footnote and dismisses it without even addressing its language. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 835, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>fn. 9.) The majority also acknowledges that the arbitration statutes define the basic characteristics and effect of arbitration proceedings and apply \u201ceven absent the specific agreement of the parties.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 831.) Yet, in the same breath, the majority concludes that parties must specifically agree to the application of nonmutual collateral estoppel even though section 1287.4 makes no mention of any such requirement. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 835.) Finally, the majority inexplicably concludes that the parties in this case did not intend to give the arbitration award collateral estoppel effect despite their massive expenditure of time and resources in the arbitral proceedings. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 837, 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The majority\u2019s use of public policy considerations to circumvent section 1287.4 is just as specious. This case does not present a question of common law policy; it presents a question of statutory interpretation. The court is not at liberty to reject the plain meaning of a statute merely because it believes the statute implements an unwise policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">In any event, most of the cited public policy considerations actually repudiate the majority\u2019s position. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s conclusory statements to the contrary, its decision today undermines public confidence in the judicial system. First, denying judicially confirmed arbitration awards collateral estoppel effect creates the risk of inconsistent rulings. (See <em>Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 347 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223, 2 A.L.R.5th 995].) Because the Legislature has given these arbitration awards \u201cequal status\u201d to court judgments, any inconsistencies between the rulings of the arbitrator and court would have a profoundly negative impact on the integrity of our judicial system. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Second, leaving the determination of the collateral estoppel effect of a judicially confirmed arbitration to the parties creates the possibility that summary proceedings lacking \u201cjudicial character\u201d will have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. Such a result not only contravenes well-established precedents (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 468, 479 [186 Cal.Rptr. 77, 651 P.2d 321]; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Trans Globe Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 195, 202-203 [131 Cal.Rptr. 488]), but also threatens the integrity of judicial decisions. Because individual litigants often have little choice when entering into arbitration agreements, binding these individuals to rulings made without a full and fair opportunity to litigate creates an unavoidable perception of unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Denying judicially confirmed arbitrations collateral estoppel effect also undermines judicial economy. The majority correctly recognizes that private arbitrations do not waste judicial resources because they do not involve \u201cthe use of a judge and a courtroom.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 833.) Indeed, the Legislature enacted the arbitration statutes in order to provide a viable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>alternative to the courts. (See <em>Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899] <em>(Moncharsh).) </em>This, however, does not support the conclusion that later relitigation has no effect on judicial economy. If arbitration awards have collateral estoppel effect, relitigation\u2014 including additional discovery, motions and trials\u2014would not be necessary. Thus, courts could avoid this needless dissipation of judicial resources by deciding just <em>one </em>motion addressing the collateral estoppel effect of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Finally, in perhaps the greatest irony of all, the majority\u2019s foray into legislative enactment will likely have the very \u201cadverse effects\u201d on arbitrations that it seeks to prevent. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 836.) As an initial matter, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the pressure to conform the arbitral process to the litigation process will discourage the use of arbitrations is suspect. Even if arbitrations become more like litigation, they still have several inherent advantages, including greater limits on discovery, more flexible hearing and trial dates, limited judicial review and the ability to choose arbitrators with expertise in the type of controversy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Instead, the majority decision may also make many commercial disputes inarbitrable or encourage procedural gamesmanship. Commercial disputes often involve nonparties to the arbitration agreement. If the majority is correct and tactical considerations weigh against agreements according non-mutual collateral estoppel effect to judicially confirmed arbitration awards, then the guaranteed \u201cpossibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact\u201d in disputes involving nonparties will lead to two probable outcomes. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (c).) Courts will either deny or stay arbitration or order arbitration and stay the action against nonparties to the arbitration agreement. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Mercury Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 347-348 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178].) The first outcome makes otherwise arbitrable disputes inarbitrable in direct contravention of the strong public policy in favor of arbitration. (See <em>Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 9.) The second outcome gives a party asserting claims against nonarbitrating parties an undeserved second bite at the apple if they are not satisfied with the arbitration award. We have already rejected similar forms of \u201cprocedural gamesmanship\u201d where a party attempts to combine litigation and arbitration in order to obtain an unfair advantage. <em>(Christensen </em>v. <em>Dewor Developments </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 778, 784 [191 Cal.Rptr. 8, 661 P.2d 1088].)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u2022 Even if arbitral parties avoid these outcomes by agreeing to give the arbitration nonmutual collateral estoppel effect, they, by the majority\u2019s reasoning, will likely insist on the same sort of procedural safeguards that exist in litigation. Thus, the majority\u2019s decision, at best, would have the same effect on arbitrations as the case-by-case approach that it rejects.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Accordingly, I believe the only reasoned view is to determine the applicability of collateral estoppel on a case-by-case basis. If the parties have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in arbitration, then a judicially confirmed arbitration award has nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. If the parties do not, then the award does not have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect. By rejecting this approach, the majority ignores the plain language of section 1287.4, the overall statutory scheme governing arbitrations in California and the clear weight of authority\u2014including the decisions of our sister states with similar statutes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Restatement of Judgments,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and most commentators and treatises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, the majority sends a clear message to the Legislature\u2014\u201cjudicial hostility\u201d to arbitration still trumps. <em>(Madden </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 707 [131 Cal.Rptr. 882, 552 P.2d 1178].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The petition of real party in interest United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company for a rehearing was denied October 20, 1999. George, C. J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">For example, Connecticut, Idaho, Nevada and New York all have statutes similar to section 1287.4 and have concluded that final and binding arbitration decisions have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect.

Douglas Galt for Defendant and Respondent.</p>\n<p>OPINION</p>\n<p>ARMSTRONG, J.</p>\n<p>This appeal raises an issue regarding the scope of personal injury coverage in a policy of insurance issued to appellants Martin Marietta Corporation, Martin Marietta Carbon, Inc., and Martin Marietta Aluminum (Martin Marietta) by respondent Insurance Company of North America (INA). Specifically, we are asked to determine whether policy language insuring Martin Marietta's liability for \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" provides coverage for specified actions, brought by a variety of governmental entities, which require, or seek to require, Martin Marietta to remediate groundwater and other contamination emanating from landfill and other sites. The trial court granted summary adjudication and judgment in favor of INA, after determining that under the policy there was no potential for coverage for the claims at issue, and that INA had no duty to defend or indemnify Martin Marietta. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>Factual and Procedural Summary</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>In this action, Martin Marietta claimed insurance coverage from INA and many other of its liability insurers for actions brought against it by federal and state governmental entities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 United States Code section 9601 et seq. (CERCLA), the Resource, Conservation and Recovery <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1118</span> Act, 42 United States Code section 6001 et seq. (RCRA) and similar statutes and theories. The actions related to the remediation of groundwater and other contamination emanating from a number of landfill and other sites. As to INA, Martin Marietta tendered claims regarding cleanup orders and actions at seven sites: the Dalles, Oregon site; the Goldendale, Washington site; the Green River Disposal site; the Operating Industries, Inc., site; the Seymour Recycling site; the Commercial Oil Services, Inc., site; and the Stringfellow site.</p>\n<p>The INA policy at issue covers the period from May 6, 1968, to November 6, 1972, and includes only automobile coverage and the personal injury coverage at issue here. The personal injury coverage provides that \"INA will pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages[<sup>[2]</sup>] because of personal injury to which this insurance applies....\"</p>\n<p>Personal injury is defined as \"(1) bodily injury, disability, shock, mental anguish and mental injury; (2) false arrest, detention or imprisonment, or malicious prosecution; (3) the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or of other defamatory material, including disparaging statements concerning the condition, value, quality or use of real or personal property, or a publication or utterance in violation of an individual's right of privacy, except when any of this foregoing part (3) arises out of the Named Insured's advertising activities; (4) <i>wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy</i>; (5) racial or religious discrimination, unless insurance therefor is prohibited by law, not committed by or at the direction of the Named Insured.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>INA moved for summary adjudication on the ground that the claims were not \"because of personal injury,\" and that it thus had no duty to defend or indemnify Martin Marietta. Martin Marietta argued that there was a potential for coverage because \"personal injury\" is defined in the policy to include \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" and that there was thus a duty to defend. Martin Marietta argued, and argues, that under the quoted portion of definition the policy provides coverage for actions based on common law theories of trespass and nuisance, that the governmental actions are based at least in part on those theories, and that the governmental actions include allegations of wrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1119</span> With its motion, INA proposed undisputed facts. Martin Marietta did not dispute those facts, but offered additional facts regarding each claim, which were in large part undisputed by INA. We summarize these undisputed facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Dalles, Oregon site</i></h2>\n<p>This site is owned by Martin Marietta. In a consent decree, Martin Marietta agreed to take remedial measures proposed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to clean up groundwater contamination. The EPA and the State of Oregon alleged liability under CERCLA, including allegations that the actions required by the consent decree were necessary to protect the public health and welfare, that businesses and one residence depended on the contaminated groundwater for drinking, and that fourteen thousand people were served by the groundwater. The consent decree required Martin Marietta to obtain consent of property owners where cleanup work was to be performed. Under the consent decree, the EPA and the State of Oregon agreed to forego claims under CERCLA, the RCRA, and the common law, including common law nuisance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Goldendale, Washington site</i></h2>\n<p>This site, too, is owned by Martin Marietta. The State of Washington's Department of Ecology discovered groundwater contamination at the facility and ordered Martin Marietta to implement a cleanup plan. The order alleged violation of a state environmental statute designed in part to protect the public health.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Green River disposal site</i></h2>\n<p>This is a landfill site, regarding which Martin Marietta is subject to an EPA order alleging CERCLA liability and ordering remediation of contamination of a creek and of groundwater, in part to protect the public from endangerment. The EPA order referred to migration of contaminants and to the presence of arsenic in a nearby well, and alleged that 2,600 people lived within a 3-mile radius of the site and that there was a significant threat of individual contact with contaminants. Martin Marietta was ordered to conduct a well survey which would include the landowner's identity and the landowner's comments regarding water taste and odor, to supply an acceptable alternate supply of drinking water to all adversely impacted parties, and to obtain site access agreements from the owners of land subject to cleanup.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Operating Industries, Inc., site</i></h2>\n<p>This site is also a landfill. Under a consent decree with the EPA, Martin Marietta and others agreed to construct and maintain a leachate treatment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1120</span> system on this site. The EPA alleged that the actions required of Martin Marietta were necessary to protect the public welfare. The EPA also alleged the off-site migration of contaminants, that the release of hazardous substances from the site posed a threat to human health; that there were several residences adjacent to the site, 53,000 residences within a 3-mile radius of the site, and several businesses on or near the site; and that methane levels exceeded the lower exposure limit in nearby residential areas. Martin Marietta was ordered to use good faith efforts to obtain access agreements from persons who had control over the property where work was to be performed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Seymour recycling site</i></h2>\n<p>Regarding this site, the EPA filed a complaint alleging imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and welfare due to groundwater contamination. Martin Marietta agreed to be bound by a consent decree requiring it to seal and abandon wells, including approximately 100 residential and business wells, to impose deed restrictions and other enforceable instruments restricting private residential or commercial use of property on or surrounding the site, to conduct a survey of residences and businesses in the site area to determine if the owners wished to have a well on the property sealed, and to seal all wells for which it had the owner's permission. In return, the United States and the state government agreed not to sue under CERCLA, the RCRA, or common law theories.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Commercial Oil Services, Inc., site</i></h2>\n<p>The EPA notified Martin Marietta that it might be liable for cleanup of this site, alleging liability under CERCLA. The EPA alleged that three lagoons at the site were contaminated with PCB's, oil, and sludge, so that rainfall could result in those contaminants spilling into a nearby creek and into Lake Erie.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Stringfellow site</i></h2>\n<p>In the action regarding this site, the EPA and the State of California sued under CERCLA, the RCRA, common law protections of the public health, safety, and welfare and of the state's natural resources, and a number of California statutes. Those statutes included Health and Safety Code section 205, which authorizes the Department of Health Services to, inter alia, commence and maintain actions to abate nuisance, and Civil Code sections 3479-3496, concerning actions for nuisance. The Montrose Chemical Corporation, sued in the action, brought a third party complaint against Martin Marietta, incorporating by reference the government's claims and seeking contribution and indemnity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1121</span> As to this site, Martin Marietta also proposed as an undisputed fact that an individual and an organization called Concerned Neighbors in Action filed a complaint in intervention alleging nuisance and seeking relief under CERCLA, the RCRA, and common law theories.<sup>[3]</sup> INA disputed the fact, citing in support the order granting Concerned Neighbors leave to intervene, which INA contends allowed intervention \"only for the purpose of pressing claims alleged by the governmental plaintiffs.\" However, INA did not dispute Martin Marietta's next proposed fact, that the Montrose complaint incorporated by reference the allegations of the intervener's claims.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted INA's summary adjudication motion<sup>[4]</sup> and entered judgment for INA. In its order, the trial court found that \"the INA policy's coverage for certain damages because of personal injury cannot reasonably be construed as including government pollution clean up claims.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Discussion</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Standard of Review/Burden on Summary Adjudication</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Both INA's burden on its motion for summary adjudication and the scope of our review of the trial court ruling are well known. (1) \"A defendant who moves for summary judgment must either <i>prove</i> an affirmative defense which would bar every cause of action pled in the complaint or <i>disprove</i> at least one essential element of each cause of action in the complaint. [Citation.] The moving party must show that under no possible hypothesis within the reasonable purview of the allegations of the complaint is there a material question of fact which requires examination by trial. [Citations.] If the defendant does not satisfy its burden as the moving party, the motion must be denied.... [\u00b6] In evaluating the correctness of [the] ruling ..., we must independently review the record before the trial court. Because the grant or denial of [the] motion ... involves pure questions of law, we are required to reassess the legal significance and effect of the papers presented by the parties in connection with the motion.... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] In practical effect, we assume the role of a trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.

INA's burden on its motion was thus to establish that there is no triable issue of fact on its sole contention: that none of the allegations brought against Martin Marietta creates a potential for coverage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Contentions of the Parties</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Martin Marietta claims the potential for coverage as to each site under the policy provision which defines personal injury to include \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\" INA contends that when read in the context of the entire policy, that clause provides coverage only for \"classic landlord/tenant-type disputes.\" Under INA's interpretation, \"wrongful entry or eviction\" refers only to forcible eviction claims brought by one with a possessory interest in the land, and \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" extends that coverage to claims brought by occupants, rather than owners. INA also argues that claims asserted by governmental entities do not enforce private rights, and are therefore outside the grant of coverage, and that the coverage extends only to injury to the person and not to the property damage which INA contends is all that is at issue in the actions against Martin Marietta.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Rules of Policy Interpretation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(2) In interpreting this insurance policy, we are governed by established rules. We interpret the policy as a whole, in a manner which gives force and effect to every clause. The fundamental goal is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties. If contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs. If there is an ambiguity, it is construed against the party who caused the ambiguity to exist. This rule protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.

Emphasis on the expectations of the insured at the time the policy is entered into does not preclude coverage of forms of liability created after the formation of the policy. \"The sole relevant inquiry in determining whether such types of liability are covered is whether, in view of the reasonable expectations of the insured, policy language can be interpreted to embrace the liability that may accrue under new statutory schemes.\" (<i>AIU Ins.

(Lathrop, Insurance Coverage for Environmental Claims (1992) \u00a7 3.06[2], p. 3-64, fn. 9; Croskey &amp; Kaufman, Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 1995) \u00b6 7:1066, p. 7C-13.) The clause has been interpreted in a number of cases. A number of other cases cited to us interpret a revised version of the clause, adopted by the Insurance Services Organization as part of the 1986 standard form comprehensive general liability policy. That version omits the phrase \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" and defines personal injury as \"injury, other than bodily injury, arising out of ... The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor....\" (Lathrop, Insurance Coverage for Environmental Claims, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 3.06[2], pp. 3-65, 3-67 fn. 21; Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <i>supra,</i> \u00b6 7:1112, p. 7C-21.)</p>\n<p>We begin our review of the case law with the California cases which interpret \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" outside the context of pollution claims. We next review the few California cases which discuss personal injury coverage for pollution claims, and conclude with a review of the federal and out-of-state cases on that subject.</p>\n<p>In general, the California cases on \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" reject attempts to apply the coverage to claims other than those which concern an invasion of an interest <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1124</span> in real property. For example, in <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Great American Ins. Companies</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112849/nichols-v-great-american-ins-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>], the lawsuit against the insured included the allegation that the insured was engaged in the sale of devices which intercepted Home Box Office (HBO) signals. The court rejected the insured's argument that the suit included a claim of violation of the HBO licensee's right to occupy the microwave channel, and was therefore covered under \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\" The court cited the rule that words in an insurance policy are to be given their plain and ordinary meanings, and quoted a dictionary definition of \"occupancy\" as \"the taking and holding possession of real property under a lease or tenancy at will.\" The court then noted that \"the association of `occupancy' with real property ... is reinforced by its conjunction with the words `wrongful entry or eviction,'\" and concluded that, reading the clause as a whole, coverage was provided only for wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy relating to some interest in real property. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 775-776.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>Waranch</i> v. <i>Gulf Insurance Co.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>] the court found that \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" did not provide coverage for a claim of wrongful repossession of an automobile. The court reviewed case law from California and from other jurisdictions, concluding that no court had applied \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" outside the realm of real property. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 361; see also <i>Fragomeno</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of the West</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253301/fibreboard-corp-v-hartford-acc-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court first held that \"In the world of liability insurance, personal injury coverage applies to injury which arises out of the commission of certain enumerated acts or offenses. [Citations.] Coverage thus is triggered by the offense, not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 511; accord, <i>Legarra</i> v. <i>Federated Mutual Ins.

App.3d at p. 832 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.) [\"... the term personal [in `personal injury'] is used in a highly specialized sense. It does not mean <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1125</span> physical damage to a person; rather it means injury arising out of one or more specified offenses,\" quoting 3 Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1988) \u00a7 49.40[3], pp. 49-69].) The court also noted that \"[t]o the extent the listed offenses are framed in generic terms, they should be construed broadly to encompass all specific torts which reasonably could fall within the general category.\" (16 Cal. App.4th at p. 515.)</p>\n<p><i>Fibreboard</i> next examined the phrase \"wrongful entry,\" and rejected definitions proffered by the insurer which included the use or threat of force to dispossess, similar to the definition INA urges here. The court found that \"[a]lthough wrongful entry can describe a trespass committed for the specific purpose of dispossessing the owner or occupant of the land, ... it can also describe a more general, `simple trespass' involving no intent to dispossess: `\"Every wrongful entry upon land in the occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass....\"' (<i>MacLeod</i> v. <i>Fox West Coast T. Corp.</i> (1937) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617147\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617147/macleod-v-fox-west-coast-t-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 387 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></span>].)\" (16 Cal. App.4th at pp. 511-512.) In <i>Fibreboard,</i> however, the court found no coverage, since there was no direct or indirect entry by Fibreboard on the underlying plaintiffs' land, and a manufacturer does not commit a trespass through its products.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>(3) These cases thus teach that under California law, the language \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is limited to tort claims relating to the invasion of an interest in real property. \"Wrongful entry\" includes trespass claims, even if those claims do not involve an intent to dispossess. And, contrary to INA's argument here, personal injury coverage is not determined by the nature of the damages sought in the action against the insured, but by the nature of the claims made against the insured in that action. Under the policy definition, \"[c]overage ... is triggered by the offense, not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers.\" (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 16 Cal. App.4th at p. 511.) This conclusion is consistent with the policy language which obligates INA to pay \"<i>all sums</i> which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury....\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>With this summary in hand, we turn to the California cases which concern the application of personal injury coverage to pollution claims. INA argues that <i>Titan Corp.</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span> </span><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1126</span> correctly decided the issue before us. That case found no coverage for pollution damages under a coverage clause identical to the one at issue here. However, unlike Martin Marietta's INA policy, the insurance policy under review in <i>Titan Corp.</i> contained a pollution exclusion which \"unambiguously declared\" that the policy would not pay for either bodily injury or property damage caused by pollution. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 474.) The reasoning and result in <i>Titan Corp.</i> depends in large part on that exclusion, and thus is in large part inapplicable here.</p>\n<p>In <i>Titan Corp.,</i> the plaintiff made a claim on its insurer for indemnification for the cost of complying with an order issued by the New Jersey Environmental Protection Agency which required the cleanup of waste sludge, scrap material, and potential sources of groundwater contamination. In analyzing Titan's claim for coverage under the personal injury provision, the court cited principles of law requiring a contract to be read as a whole and interpreted in a manner which gives force and effect to every clause. The court reasoned that if the personal injury provision were read to cover third party property damage caused by pollution, the pollution exclusion would never operate, an improper result. Reading the exclusion and the coverage provisions together, the court found that personal injury coverage was \"limited to damages <i>other</i> than the injury to realty which an occupier of land may suffer when his quiet enjoyment of occupancy is disturbed.\" (22 Cal. App.4th at pp. 473-474.) It is clear that this analysis has no bearing on the case before us, since the policy before us has no pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p><i>Titan Corp.</i> went on to analyze cases from other jurisdictions concerning personal injury coverage for pollution damages, most of which interpreted policies which had pollution exclusions, and concluded that \"[t]he term `other invasion of the right of private occupancy' draws meaning and content from the preceding language: `wrongful entry or eviction.' Such language connotes disruptions of the ability of a landowner to actually occupy his property, not mere injury to property. [Citation.] In brief, we do not believe it is objectively reasonable for an insured to expect `personal injury' to mean `property damage,' or to expect contamination of groundwater to harm either a `private' right or an `occupancy' right, or to expect that a blanket pollution exclusion will never operate.\" (22 Cal. App.4th at p. 476.) The court cited the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i>; that where general words follow a specific enumeration, the general words should not be construed in their broadest sense but should be read as applying to the same general class of things as the specifically enumerated things. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 474-476; see <i>id.,</i> fn. 14.) From this rule, the court concluded that \"`other invasion' should be interpreted to mean the functional equivalent of `wrongful entry or eviction.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 475.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1127</span> In this alternative holding, <i>Titan Corp.</i> seems to depart from California law. First, to the extent that the case, by requiring \"disruption of the ability of a landowner to actually occupy his property,\" would find no coverage for trespass or similar claims, it disagrees with <i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span>. Our own analysis, set out in greater detail later in this opinion, is that on this point, <i>Fibreboard</i> is correct. We also cannot agree that because the coverage is titled \"personal injury\" the insured could not reasonably expect the coverage to apply to acts which amount to trespass, nuisance, and similar causes of action. As we have seen, it is established California law that coverage under a personal injury provision is not determined by the damages sought from the insured, but by the nature of the tort claims alleged against it. (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.</span> supra</span>,</i> at p. 511; <i>Legarra</i> v. <i>Federated Mutual Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.</span> supra</span>,</i> 35 Cal. App.4th at p. 1484.)</p>\n<p>We would apply the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> differently: under that principle, \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" and \"wrongful entry\" can apply only to the general class of things to which \"eviction\" clearly belongs, that is, to claims relating to an invasion of an interest in real property. To read \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" \"wrongful entry,\" and \"eviction\" as equivalents would violate another fundamental rule of contract interpretation, that each part of the policy must be given force and effect. (<i>Pico Citizens Bank</i> v. <i>Tafco, Inc.</i> (1958) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></span>, 746 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></span>]; <i>Union Oil Co.</i> v. <i>International Ins.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></span>] [where policy ambiguous \"an interpretation that gives effect to every clause is preferred over one that would render other policy terms meaningless\"].) If \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" means only \"wrongful entry or eviction,\" it has no meaning. As we explain later in this opinion, we do not so construe the policy.</p>\n<p><i>Titan Corp.</i>'s holding regarding the interaction between a pollution exclusion and personal injury coverage has been followed by two California cases. Although the issue is not directly before us, since Martin Marietta's INA policy has no pollution exclusion, the cases are of interest. In <i>Legarra</i> v. <i>Federated Mutual Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1472</span></span>, the insured's policy contained a personal injury coverage clause identical to that before us, as well as a pollution exclusion. The insured sought coverage for a demand by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the cleanup of groundwater contamination on the insured's property. The court reviewed the California case law on personal injury coverage, and a number of federal and out-of-state cases which considered the application of that coverage to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1128</span> pollution claims, and concluded that given the differing interpretations, the clause could be considered ambiguous if read in isolation, and that in the abstract the coverage might apply to pollution claims. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1485.) That is, of course, the analytical problem before us: since Martin Marietta's policy has no pollution exclusion, the personal injury provision must be read \"in isolation.\" In <i>Legarra,</i> however, court found that in light of the pollution exclusion and the rule of interpretation requiring the policy be interpreted as a whole, giving effect to every part, the personal injury provision did not provide coverage for pollution damage to real property. To hold otherwise would nullify the pollution exclusion, an improper result. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1486.)</p>\n<p><i>Union Oil Co.</i> v. <i>International Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></span>, concerned personal injury coverage for a lawsuit for damages caused by a leaking underground gasoline tank. The policy contained both a pollution exclusion and personal injury coverage for wrongful eviction, wrongful entry, and \"violation of personal rights.\" Following <i>Titan Corp.</i>'s reasoning that a finding of coverage would render the pollution exclusion meaningless, the court found no duty. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 940.)</p>\n<p>The parties have also cited a number of federal cases and cases from other jurisdictions. We begin with the cases cited by INA.

The court then cited California law defining trespass as an invasion of the interest in the exclusive possession of land and defining nuisance as an interference with the interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.

In that case, the insured sold an electrical transformer as scrap. The transformer released gallons of toxic chemicals, and the insured was sued for the amount of cleanup costs incurred by the buyer under state and federal law, costs associated with restricted access to the site after a state environmental agency placed a seal order on the property, and other costs. The insurance company argued that the personal injury clause, in pertinent part identical to the one before us, covered only conduct undertaken by one claiming interest in the property and intended to deprive the other party of the right to occupy the property, similar to INA's arguments here. <i>Pipefitters</i> found that under relevant state law, \"wrongful entry\" is substantially similar to trespass, and that trespass does not require an intent to occupy. Therefore, the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> did not limit coverage under the \"catch-all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1131</span> phrase\" regarding \"other invasions\" to conduct undertaken with a motive to deprive another of possession. Since the complaint against the insured arguably alleged an \"other invasion,\" the court concluded that there was a duty to defend.</p>\n<p>The Seventh Circuit returned to this question in <i>Scottish Guarantee Ins.

There, the court considered the insurance company's duty to defend a claim that chemicals released from the insured's insulation business property had contaminated neighbors' wells, in a policy which covered only wrongful entry or eviction. The court concluded that the phrase \"wrongful entry\" was at the very least ambiguous, and that unintentional trespass was covered.</p>\n<p>Finally, <i>Blackhawk-Central City</i> v. <i>American Guaranty</i> (D.Colo. 1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></span>, 590, considered claims of nuisance and trespass, based on a pollution emanating from a waste treatment facility, and held that there was a duty to defend. The court found that the pollution exclusion in several of the policies applied only to bodily injury and property damage coverages, and not to the personal injury coverage, which was similar to the clause before us here. The court found that wrongful entry was \"substantially analogous\" to trespass, that a person of ordinary intelligence would have understood the personal injury coverage to include trespass and nuisance claims, and that at the very least, \"wrongful entry\" was ambiguous and must be construed in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Policy Interpretation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>It is apparent that the federal and out-of-state cases lack a consensus of approach and of result. Many concern insurance policies which are in important ways different than the one we are called on to interpret. We base our ruling on the policy before us, and on the California rules of interpretation recited earlier in this opinion, and find that we cannot accept INA's contention that the coverage clause at issue is limited to \"classic landlord/tenant\" claims.</p>\n<p>Under California law, where words bear a simple and clear meaning, we apply that meaning. (<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Court,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 2 Cal.4th at pp. 1264-1265.) (4) Applying this rule, it seems manifest that \"wrongful entry,\" in the context of torts relating to the invasion of an interest in real property, includes trespass and may include nuisance, and that a reasonable insured would so understand the coverage. We also find that \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is ambiguous, since it is susceptible to more than one interpretation. (See <i>Legarra</i> v. <i>Federated Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1132</span> <i>supra,</i> 35 Cal. App.4th at p. 1485.) When construed, as it must be, in favor of the insured, the phrase may include nuisance claims and other of the claims brought against Martin Marietta.</p>\n<p>INA argues that neither trespass nor nuisance claims are covered, because neither is among the torts specifically enumerated in the policy. However, the language of the policy clearly encompasses those causes of action, and there is no requirement, in the policy or in the law, that each covered cause of action be \"specifically enumerated.\" Instead, the policy states that it covers claims based on eviction, and claims based on two other kinds of causes of action: wrongful entry, and invasions of the right of private occupancy other than eviction or wrongful entry. The terms are not defined in the policy, or in the law, but they are not on that account without meaning.</p>\n<p>\"Wrongful entry\" is a term not altogether foreign to the law. Our Supreme Court long ago said, \"It is elementary law, that every wrongful entry upon lands in the occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass, ...\" (<i>Triscony</i> v. <i>Brandenstein</i> (1885) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 515 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span>]; see also <i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.</span> supra</span>,</i> 16 Cal. App.4th at p. 512.) \"`The essence of the cause of action for trespass is an \"unauthorized entry\" onto the land of another.'

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>Further, it is established that trespass and nuisance claims may include wrongful entry or invasion by pollutants. Trespass may be \"`by personal intrusion of the wrongdoer or by his failure to leave; by throwing or placing something on the land; or by causing the entry of some other person....'\" A trespass may be on the surface of the land, above it, or below it. (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Torts, \u00a7 604, p. 704.) The migration of pollutants from one property to another may constitute a trespass, a nuisance, or both. (<i>Cassinos</i> v. <i>Union Oil <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>].) To agree with INA that \"wrongful entry\" does not include trespass and nuisance claims would fly in the face of this long-standing law.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1133</span> INA contends that rather than referring to trespass and nuisance, \"wrongful entry\" requires proof that a defendant entered a plaintiff's land with force and violence or threats thereof, and with the intent to oust the plaintiff from possession. INA cites in support Code of Civil Procedure section 1159, which defines \"forcible entry\" for purposes of unlawful detainer proceedings, and <i>Jordan</i> v. <i>Talbot</i> (1961) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1295419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1295419/jordan-v-talbot/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span> </a></span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Neither authority has application to the question before us here. The policy simply does not say \"forcible entry,\" or indeed give any hint that only that claim will be covered. We decline to read into the policy terms and restrictions not expressly contained therein.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that \"wrongful entry\" encompasses trespass and may encompass nuisance seems to us to be a straightforward one. \"Other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is more complex, since neither party has cited any use of that term elsewhere in the law. In order to give force and effect to each word of the policy, the invasions referred to must be something other than eviction or wrongful entry. Under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the invasions referred to must be similar to those involved in eviction and trespass claims.</p>\n<p>(5) INA argues that the definition of \"occupancy\" defeats coverage, arguing that occupancy \"is an incident of ownership and connotes actual use,\" and citing in support a number of definitions of that word.<sup>[7]</sup> From this premise, INA argues that there is no coverage for the governmental claims against Martin Marietta, since the government does not occupy the groundwater. INA characterizes the claims as ones \"seeking to protect the public's undivided, non-exclusive residual interest in groundwater.\" Similarly, INA urges that the use of the word \"private\" excludes coverage, because it means that the party claiming the right must \"have a legal, exclusive, interest in the premises,\" something distinct from the government's interests in groundwater.</p>\n<p>The argument misunderstands the undisputed facts regarding the claims against Martin Marietta. INA has not established that the government is seeking to enforce only a public or residual interest in groundwater. Instead, the undisputed facts indicate that the government claims include allegations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1134</span> that pollutants emanating from Martin Marietta have contaminated the water wells and groundwater on land owned by individuals, businesses, and, perhaps, governmental entities. INA essentially argues that, even if a claim would be covered if brought by an individual property owner, the claim is not covered if it is brought by the government. INA cites no policy language which would support this argument, and we see none. We do not believe that a reasonable insured would have so understood the policy. Under the policy, it is not the identity of the plaintiff which determines coverage, but the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p>It is apparent, too, that \"occupancy\" may be something other than an incident of ownership. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"occupancy\" as \"[t]aking possession of property and use of the same.... e.g. of a tenant's use of leased premises,\" and defines \"possession\" as \"[h]aving control over a thing with the intent to have and to exercise such control.\" (Black's Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) pp. 1078, col. 2, 1163, col. 1.) The rights which attend occupancy may be, arguably, many.</p>\n<p>\"Invasion of the right of private occupancy\" resembles the definition of nuisance, an \"`interference with the interest in the private use and enjoyment of the land.'\" (<i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Interlake Steel Co.</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1319647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1319647/wilson-v-interlake-steel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 233 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1319647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1319647/wilson-v-interlake-steel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Code, \u00a7 3279.) \"The typical and familiar nuisance claim involves an activity or condition which causes damage or other interference with the enjoyment of adjoining or neighboring land.\" (<i>Wilshire Westwood Associates</i> v. <i>Atlantic Richfield Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Law, <i>supra,</i> Equity, \u00a7 126, p. 807.)</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we need not determine the entire scope of coverage under the term. As to the issue before us, \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" is susceptible to numerous interpretations, and under California's rules of contract interpretation, it must be construed in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p>INA disputes the existence of any ambiguity, but argues that if one exists, it must be construed against Martin Marietta, because as the author of the \"unique structure of the insuring agreement,\" Martin Marietta caused the uncertainty to exist. INA cites in support the undisputed fact that Martin Marietta purchased only personal injury insurance from INA, and purchased other liability insurance elsewhere. (6) However, we depart from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1135</span> normal rule of interpretation, that ambiguities are interpreted in favor of coverage, only where there is \"evidence that the provision in question was jointly drafted; merely showing that policy terms were negotiated, and that the insured had legal sophistication and substantial relative bargaining power, is not enough.\" (<i>Shell Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></span>, 738 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257589\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257589/shell-oil-co-v-winterthur-swiss-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>].) As we have seen, Martin Marietta is not the author of the coverage provision, which is standard form language adopted by the insurance industry. We cannot see that Martin Marietta created any ambiguity, and we construe the language against the promissor, INA, and in favor of coverage. (<i>AIU Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Court,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 51 Cal.3d at p. 822)</p>\n<p>Finally, INA argues that in interpreting this contract, we must consider the undisputed fact that for the period of the INA policy, Martin Marietta also purchased a property damage liability policy. INA argues that Martin Marietta would not have purchased coverage for groundwater contamination claims in a personal injury policy, either in addition to or instead of the property damage policy, that the purchase of two policies suggests that Martin Marietta thought of the coverages as distinct, and that the expectation of the insured was that the INA policy would not cover claims which are based on groundwater contamination. The single undisputed fact does not compel the finding INA suggests. We do not know the terms of the property policy, or that it covers, and was intended to cover, the claims at issue. It is certainly possible for an insured to have duplicative coverage, or arguably duplicative coverage, either deliberately or inadvertently. Indeed, an entire body of law has developed to regulate that situation. (<i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Partridge</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></span>, 97 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We conclude that INA has not met that burden.</p>\n<p>The claims are based in part on trespass and nuisance. For instance, it is undisputed that the claim against Martin Marietta regarding the Stringfellow <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1136</span> site incorporated the government allegations made pursuant to nuisance statutes and common law theories, and that the intervener's claim, incorporated by reference into the claim against Martin Marietta, included a cause of action for nuisance. The consent order regarding the Dalles site specifically recites that it is in lieu of, inter alia, a nuisance claim. As we have seen, such claims raise a potential for coverage under \"wrongful entry\" and \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\"</p>\n<p>To the extent that the claims against Martin Marietta are, instead, brought pursuant to statutory provisions not in existence when the parties entered into the INA policy, \"[t]he sole relevant inquiry ... is whether, in view of the reasonable expectations of the insured, policy language can be interpreted to embrace the liability that may accrue under new statutory schemes.\" (<i>AIU Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Court,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 51 Cal.3d at p. 822, fn. 8.) In our view, on the undisputed facts, the claims against Martin Marietta are embraced by the policy language. For instance, at the Green River site, Martin Marietta has been ordered to remediate the contamination of wells on land owned by others. At both the Green River and Operating Industries sites, Martin Marietta has been required to obtain access agreements from other property owners, in order to clean up groundwater contamination. The Seymour recycling site consent order requires Martin Marietta to seal and abandon approximately 100 residential and business wells and to impose deed restrictions and other enforceable instruments restricting private residential or commercial use of property on or surrounding the site. The actions thus include allegations of wrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancy in real property.</p>\n<p>INA has not met its burden of establishing that there is no potential for coverage under the policy, and is not entitled to summary adjudication and judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Disposition</i></h2>\n<p>The judgment is reversed. Appellants to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p>Turner, P.J., and Grignon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>Respondent's petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 22, 1996. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  INA's request that we take judicial notice of a pleading in another action, in which Martin Marietta admits a proposed undisputed fact relating to coverage for property damage at its Waterton, Colorado facility, is denied. The pleading was not before the trial court in this case, was not subject to disputation and argument in the summary adjudication proceeding, and has no bearing on the issue before us.</p>\n<p>[2]  It is settled that the basic forms of relief sought by governmental entities in CERCLA suits are damages for purposes of insurance coverage.

Stringfellow (U.S. Dist. Ct., C.D.Cal., 1983, No. Civ. 83-2501) presented no potential for liability for personal injury as defined in the policy. The motion was denied. Martin Marietta now asks us to order the trial court to rule in its favor on the motion. The denial of a motion for summary adjudication is not an appealable order, and we decline to make the order Martin Marietta requests. (Code Civ.

That court noted that the coverage in that policy, for \"`other invasion of an individual's right of privacy'\" was addressed to \"a distinctly different type of tort\" than those addressed by the more usual clause (such as the one before us here) \"`\"other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\"'\" (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 16 Cal.

App.3d at page 775; \"`the taking and holding possession of real property under a lease or tenancy at will.'\" As we have seen, <i>Nichols</i> cited the definition in support of its holding that \"`other invasion of the right of private occupancy'\" was limited to claims which involve an allegation of invasion of an interest in real property, and was not otherwise concerned with the meaning of the word.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note, too, that while INA characterizes the damages sought in the actions against Martin Marietta as property damage, the undisputed facts are not so clear. Martin Marietta has been ordered, inter alia, to obtain site access agreements, to supply alternate sources of water to residences and businesses, and to conduct well surveys, items not easily characterized as property damage.</p>\n\n</div>",

We reverse because we find the exclusions the insurance company relies upon do not apply as a matter of law to the claims made against the insureds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</h2>\n<p>Although the record in this case is voluminous, it does not definitively describe the relationship between the various entities who developed the condominium project. Generally the parties agree defendant Samuel Pearlman purchased three adjoining parcels of vacant land in Carlsbad in 1972. At the time Pearlman bought the parcels they had been graded. Thereafter Pearlman formed defendant Roundtree, Ltd., a partnership. The partnership in turn formed a joint venture with defendant Twelve Trees Corporation (Twelve Trees). The joint venture was named Roundtree Condominiums, also a defendant. Defendant DMF Construction, Inc. (DMF), was retained as a general contractor to construct condominiums on the three parcels. At various stages between 1980 and 1985, Pearlman, Roundtree, Ltd., Twelve Trees, Roundtree Condominiums and DMF were each named insureds on a series of comprehensive general liability policies issued by plaintiff Maryland Casualty Company (Maryland). Significantly some of the policies included a broad form property damage endorsement.</p>\n<p>After the condominiums were completed, they were conveyed to various individuals. Between 1984 and 1987 separate purchasers of the condominiums and the homeowners association filed three complaints against Pearlman, Roundtree, Ltd., Roundtree Condominiums, Twelve Trees and DMF. The complaints alleged the plaintiffs' condominium units had been damaged by soil subsidence. The plaintiffs in the first complaint (case No. N26398) alleged their condominium was \"suffering from severe cracks in the walls and settling of the slab.\" The plaintiffs in the second complaint (case No. N34499) alleged their units \"have been damaged to the extent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*966</span> that they are rendered valueless.\" In the third complaint (case No. N38256) the homeowners association alleged the soil subsidence had caused \"cracking and separation in the concrete floor slabs, foundations, retaining walls, interior and exterior walls and ceilings, and exterior concrete patio areas and walkways at affected Condominium Units and Common Areas within the Project.\" The homeowners association also alleged the roofing system had failed \"causing rain water and moisture to penetrate the roofs, causing damage to the building structures and the contents of the affected Condominium Unit living spaces.\"</p>\n<p>On June 23, 1987, Maryland filed three complaints for declaratory relief (case Nos. N38217, N38247, N38256). Maryland's complaints asked for declaratory relief against the plaintiffs in case Nos. N26398, N34499, N38256 and each of Maryland's insureds named as defendants in those cases. Maryland alleged it had no duty to either indemnify the plaintiffs in the underlying cases or defend its insureds.</p>\n<p>The declaratory relief actions were consolidated and Maryland moved for summary judgment on the grounds the policies it issued relieved it from liability for the claims made against the contractor and the condominium developers. In the trial court Maryland argued the damage suffered by the plaintiffs in the underlying cases was not \"property damage\" within the meaning of its policies. Maryland further argued that even if property damage were involved, coverage was barred by the terms of four exclusions in its policies. Those exclusions eliminate coverage for property damage arising out of work performed by an insured, the products of an insured, premises alienated by an insured and participation in a joint venture which was not itself named as an insured under the policy.</p>\n<p>The insureds also moved for summary judgment. The insureds argued the broad form endorsement covered the claims made against them as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>Relying on what it viewed as the persuasive reasoning set forth in <i>Knutson Const.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.</i> (Minn. 1986) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2069658\"><a href=\"/opinion/2069658/knutson-const-v-st-paul-fire-marine-ins/\">396 N.W.2d 229</a></span> (<i>Knutson</i>), the trial court found the work performed exclusion applicable and granted Maryland's motion. Following entry of judgment in Maryland's favor, the named insureds, the individual condominium owners and the homeowners association filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ISSUES ON APPEAL</h2>\n<p>Because we must affirm the trial court's ruling if there is any basis in the record for doing so (see <i>Snider</i> v. <i>Snider</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation no-link\">200 Cal. App.2d 741</span>, 756 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*967</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal. Rptr. 709</span>]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 261, pp. 267-269), on appeal we must determine whether any of the grounds Maryland has urged either here or in the trial court entitled it to a summary judgment. We find no such grounds. The face of the underlying complaints discloses property damage within the meaning of Maryland's policy. Moreover the record here does not support application of any of the exclusions Maryland has asserted: the insurance industry's own interpretation of the broad form endorsement prevents application of the \"work performed\" exclusion in this case; similar industry interpretation of the \"products\" exclusion prevents its application as a matter of law; even under a broad interpretation the premises alienated exclusion only applies to one of the insureds, and, in light of later changes in the exclusion we are unwilling to accept such a broad interpretation; finally, the joint venture exclusion is unavailing because the Roundtree Condominiums joint venture may in fact have been a named insured under policies which include the broad form endorsement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Comprehensive Liability Policies</i></h2>\n<p>(1) Generally liability policies, such as the ones in dispute here, are not designed to provide contractors and developers with coverage against claims their work is inferior or defective. (See <i>Rafeiro</i> v. <i>American Employers' Ins. Co.</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Cal. App.3d 799</span>, 808-809 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">85 Cal. Rptr. 701</span>].) The risk of replacing and repairing defective materials or poor workmanship has generally been considered a commercial risk which is not passed on to the liability insurer. (See <i>Volf</i> v. <i>Ocean Accident &amp; Guar. Corp.</i> (1958) <span class=\"citation no-link\">50 Cal.2d 373</span>, 376 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">325 P.2d 987</span>] (<i>Volf</i>); <i>Western Employers Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Arciero &amp; Sons, Inc.</i> (1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">146 Cal. App.3d 1027</span>, 1031-1032 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. Rptr. 688</span>]; Macaulay, <i>Justice Traynor and the Law of Contracts</i> (1961) 13 Stan.L.Rev. 812, 825-826.) Rather liability coverage comes into play when the insured's defective materials or work cause injury to property other than the insured's own work or products. As one commentator explained: \"This distinction is significant. Replacement and repair costs are to some degree within the control of the insured. They can be minimized by careful purchasing, inspection of material, quality control and hiring policies. If replacement and repair costs were covered, the incentive to exercise care or to make repairs at the least possible cost would be lessened since the insurance company would be footing the bill for all scrap. Replacement and repair losses tend to be more frequent than losses through injury to other property, but replacement and repair losses are limited in amount since the greatest loss cannot exceed the cost of total replacement. If the insured will stand these losses, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*968</span> insurance can be provided more cheaply since the company will be freed from administering many small claims for repairs, and it can set a rate for the more unusual risk of injury to property other than the contractor's work or product. This risk can be the hazardous one since there are no natural limitations on the damage the contractor might do to a homeowner's or a neighbor's property.\" (Macaulay, <i>supra,</i> 13 Stan.L.Rev. at pp. 825-826.)</p>\n<p>In actually articulating the risks which will be covered by a liability policy common practice is \"to cover a broad risk at the beginning of the policy but to shift certain risks back to the insurance buyer by means of exclusions stated later.\" (Macaulay, <i>supra,</i> 13 Stan.L.Rev. at p. 822.) Such is the case here. At the outset Maryland's liability policy provides broad definitions of property damage and personal injury and states in its insuring clause the company will pay sums the insured becomes liable for as a result of property damage or personal injury. The insuring clause is then followed by no less than 17 exclusions which detail the myriad of circumstances in which Maryland will not cover personal injury or property damage claims.</p>\n<p>Here, in addition to a basic policy with a broad coverage provision followed by exclusions designed to shift certain risks back to the insured, we have an additional risk-altering mechanism. By paying an additional 20 percent of their basic premium some of the insureds in this case purchased an endorsement which narrowed the exclusions set forth in the basic policy. Thus the endorsement returned to Maryland some of the risks it had shifted by way of the exclusions.</p>\n<p>We also note that in drafting its policy and endorsement Maryland utilized standard form provisions prepared by the Insurance Services Organization (ISO). In addition to drafting standard form provisions, the ISO publishes circulars which describe the intent and effect of its standard provisions. As we shall explain in greater detail below, the ISO's standard provisions are also the subject of interpretation and comment by other insurance industry organizations and publications. The presence of the standard provisions in the Maryland policy and the concomitant availability of interpretative literature is of considerable assistance in determining precisely what risks the Maryland policies cover.</p>\n<p>With this background in mind we turn to the disputed provisions of the Maryland policies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Property Damage</i></h2>\n<p>Under each of the policies Maryland issued, \"property damage\" is defined as \"(1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*969</span> occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom, or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\" \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" (2) Maryland contends the damage the homeowners and their association have alleged is not property damage within the meaning of these provisions.</p>\n<p>Similar language was subject to interpretation by the court in <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Coss</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">80 Cal. App.3d 888</span>, 892 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">145 Cal. Rptr. 836</span>] (<i>Coss</i>). In <i>Coss</i> the plaintiff homeowners sued a contractor because they believed he used defective products and workmanship in constructing their home. The homeowners sought the costs they incurred in engaging architects and contractors to correct the defective work of the contractor, for loss of use of the house, for the cost of renting a substitute residence and for attorney fees incurred in prosecuting their action against Coss. In holding these losses were not property damage within the meaning of the policy, the court relied upon <i>Hamilton Die Cast, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States F. &amp; G. Co.</i> (7th Cir.1975) <span class=\"citation no-link\">508 F.2d 417</span>, 419-420 (<i>Hamilton Die Cast</i>), where a manufacturer of tennis rackets tried to recover the cost of replacing defective frames from its insurer. In rejecting that claim the <i>Hamilton Die Cast</i> court said: \"We do not think that the mere inclusion of a defective component, where no physical harm to the other parts results therefrom, constitutes `property damage' within the meaning of the policy. For example, if an automobile crash results from the failure of its defective tire, the defective component can be said to have caused `property damage' to the finished product. If, however, some of the tires purchased by the automobile manufacturer are found to be defective and the manufacturer therefore withdraws its cars from the market, there has not been `injury to or destruction of tangible property' [within the coverage provisions].\" (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 419-420.)</p>\n<p>In applying the holding in <i>Hamilton Die Cast</i> to the case before it, the <i>Coss</i> court stated: \"In our present case, the defective materials and workmanship concededly produced an inferior home, just as the poorly designed frame produced an imperfect tennis racket. <i>Hamilton Die Cast</i> concludes that poor workmanship on the delivered product is not `property damage' within the terms of the general comprehensive liability policy, and we agree.\" (<i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Coss, supra,</i> 80 Cal. App.3d at p. 893.)</p>\n<p>Like the courts in <i>Coss</i> and <i>Hamilton Die Cast</i> we do not believe inferior materials or workmanship themselves constitute \"property damage.\" We <span class=\"star-pagination\">*970</span> concede it is possible for a manufacturer or contractor to use inferior materials or methods without causing any property damage within the meaning of the Maryland policy. (See <i>Rafeiro</i> v. <i>American Employers' Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2069658\"><a href=\"/opinion/2069658/knutson-const-v-st-paul-fire-marine-ins/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Cal. App.3d 799</span>, 808-809.) However, where the defect in fact has caused either physical injury to or the lost use of tangible property, liability coverage has been found. In <i>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co.</i> (1959) <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 Cal.2d 558</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">334 P.2d 881</span>] (<i>Geddes</i>), the insured supplied a contractor with several hundred defective doors. In interpreting a coverage provision similar to Maryland's,<sup>[1]</sup> the Supreme Court found the door supplier's liability policy covered the cost of replacing the doors. The court relied upon the holding in <i>Hauenstein</i> v. <i>Saint Paul-Mercury Indem. Co.</i> (1954) <span class=\"citation no-link\">242 Minn. 354</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">65 N.W.2d 122</span>] (<i>Hauenstein</i>), where the insured supplied defective plaster which had to be removed so that the walls and ceiling could be replastered with a different material. In finding coverage the court in <i>Hauenstein</i> stated: \"No one can reasonably contend that the application of a useless plaster, which has to be removed before the walls can be properly replastered, does not lower the market value of a building. Although the injury to the walls and ceilings can be rectified by removal of the defective plaster, nevertheless, the presence of the defective plaster on the walls and ceilings reduced the value of the building and constituted property damage. The measure of damages is the diminution in the market value of the building, or the cost of removing the defective plaster and restoring the building to its former condition plus any loss from deprival of use, whichever is the lesser.\" (65 N.W.2d at p. 125, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p>In relying on this statement from <i>Hauenstein</i> the plurality in <i>Geddes</i> court distinguished its earlier decision in <i>Volf,</i> where <i>Hauenstein</i> had also been considered. \"In [<i>Volf</i>], a case involving defective plaster, we distinguished the <i>Hauenstein</i> case on the ground that in the <i>Volf</i> case it was not necessary to remove the defective plaster before replastering the house. In the present case, however, it was necessary to remove the defective doors before they could be replaced, and we see no reason for not following the <i>Hauenstein</i> case and permitting recovery for damages to the houses according to the rule stated therein.\" (<i>Geddes, supra,</i> 51 Cal.2d at p. 565; see also <i>W.E. O'Neil Const.</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins.</i> (N.D.Ill. 1989) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1419777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1419777/we-oneil-const-v-national-union-fire-ins/\">721 F. Supp. 984</a></span>, 991-992.)</p>\n<p>Here, of course, we have allegations of physical harm to tangible property. As we have seen, the homeowners and their association have alleged soil subsidence has cracked concrete floor slabs, foundations, retaining walls, interior and exterior walls and ceilings and exterior concrete patio areas. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*971</span> Moreover failure of the roofing system has allegedly allowed rain water to damage building structures and the contents of living areas. Thus, like the claimants in <i>Geddes,</i> the homeowners and their association have gone beyond allegations that defects in material and workmanship exist at the project. Accordingly, the underlying plaintiffs have alleged property damage within the meaning of the insuring provisions of the Maryland policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Work Performed</i></h2>\n<p>By its terms exclusion \"o\" of Maryland policies eliminates coverage for \"property damage to work performed <i>by or on behalf of the</i> named insured arising out of the work or any portion thereof, or out of materials, parts, or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\" (Italics added.) This language would eliminate coverage for most of the claims made by the homeowners and their association. (See <i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Imperial Contracting Co.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">212 Cal. App.3d 712</span>, 723-724 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">260 Cal. Rptr. 797</span>].) However, as we have seen, in addition to its comprehensive general liability policy, on some of the policies Maryland issued a broad form property damage endorsement. The endorsement replaces exclusion \"o\" with the following language: \"with respect to the completed operations hazard and with respect to any classification stated in the policy or in the company's manual as `including completed operations,' to property damage to work performed <i>by the</i> named insured arising out of such work or any portion thereof, or out of such materials, parts, or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\" (Italics added.) (3) The insureds and the plaintiffs in the underlying proceedings argue that by eliminating the phrase \"on behalf of the named insured,\" the endorsement provides coverage for claims arising out of work performed by subcontractors the developers and the contractor retained in developing the project. Because the insureds believe the claims made against them arise out of errors committed by soils engineers, graders and roofing subcontractors, they argue the policy provides them with coverage.</p>\n<p>The insureds' interpretation of the endorsement is supported by the insurance industry's own construction of the broad form endorsement. As we have seen, the terms of the endorsement were drafted by the ISO, which also publishes circulars designed to explain the intent, purpose and effect of its standard form provisions. In one such circular the ISO explains the broad form endorsement is intended to \"exclud[e] only damages caused by the named insured to his own work. Thus, ... [t]he insured would have coverage for damage to his work arising out of a subcontractor's work [and] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*972</span> [t]he insured would have coverage for damage to a subcontractor's work arising out of the subcontractor's work.\"</p>\n<p>The effect of the endorsement was also explained in the August 1982, Fire Casualty &amp; Surety Bulletin (FC &amp; S bulletin) published by the National Underwriters Association. The FC &amp; S bulletin is used by insurance agents and brokers to interpret standard insurance policy provisions. (<i>Fireguard Sprinkler Systems</i> v. <i>Scottsdale Ins.</i> (9th Cir.1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">864 F.2d 648</span>, 652 (<i>Fireguard</i>).) According to the FC &amp; S bulletin the work performed exclusion as it appears in the broad form endorsement \"eliminates coverage for property damage to work performed by the named insured if the property damage arises out of the named insured's work or any portion of it. [\u00b6] Thus, an insured <i>has</i> coverage for his completed work when the damage arises out of work performed by someone other than the named insured, such as a subcontractor.... The usual Completed Operations coverage (no Broad Form Property Damage endorsement attached) flatly excludes property damage to work performed by <i>or on behalf</i> of the named insured arising out of the work. Under the usual coverage, then, the insured has no insurance whatsoever for damage to a subcontractor's work, or for damage to his own work for damage resulting from a subcontractor's work. Therein lie the advantages of Broad Form Property Damage coverage including Completed Operations. Consequently, if an insured does not anticipate using subcontractors, the value of purchasing Broad Form Property Damage coverage <i>with Completed Operations</i> is questionable, in view of the additional premium required for it.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to the ISO circular and FC &amp; S bulletin, insurance industry commentators have also concluded the broad form endorsement provides coverage for work done by subcontractors. (See Gibson, Broad Form Property Damage Coverage: Analysis, Application and Alternatives 12-15 (2d ed. 1982); Audet, <i>Broad Form Completed Operations: An Extension of Coverage or a Trap?,</i> Canadian Underwriter (Oct. 1984) at p. 36.)</p>\n<p>Significantly, relying on these insurance industry interpretations, the court in <i>Fireguard</i> found that a general contractor who installed a sprinkler system at a sawmill could recover on its liability policy for damage caused when a landslide destroyed the sprinkler system, including a water tank which was installed by subcontractors. (<i>Fireguard, supra,</i> 864 F.2d at p. 655.) The landslide was allegedly the result of improper engineering, site preparation and installation performed by the water tank subcontractors. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 649.) In finding coverage under the broad form endorsement for damage to the completed project caused by the subcontractors' work, the <i>Fireguard</i> court declined to follow two Minnesota cases, <i>Knutson</i> and <i>Borson Bldg. Corp.</i> v. <i>Employers Com. Union</i> (Minn. 1982) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1857158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1857158/bor-son-bldg-corp-v-employers-coml-union/\">323 N.W.2d 58</a></span> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*973</span> (<i>Bor-son</i>), which found the effect a subcontractors's work might have on a completed project was a business risk of the general contractor which could not be passed on to a liability insurer by way of the broad form endorsement.</p>\n<p>In <i>Knutson</i> the Minnesota Supreme Court reasoned deletion of the phrase \"on behalf of the named insured\" was insignificant because \"`the insured contractor has presumably accepted the subcontractor's work as his own (at least so far as its potential tort liability is concerned), and has turned the completed work over to the owner by the time such a completed operations policy is operative.'\" (396 N.W.2d at p. 237.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Fireguard</i> the court rejected the Minnesota limitation on risks which may be covered by a liability policy. \"If a general contractor's liability policy insures against risks outside his or her control, such a risk surely can arise from a subcontractor's work. Having selected subcontractors, a general contractor may have little or no effective control over the manner in which subcontractors perform work. There are many situations where a general contractor knows little, if anything, about the exigencies of a subcontractor's work. An example is the soil testing performed prior to a construction project, which typically is subcontracted. Consequently, it is not out of the question that policies are drafted to cover risks from a subcontractor's work. From this perspective, we find unpersuasive the argument that because the prime contractor's control makes the work of a subcontractor a contractual business risk, the prime contractor should not be able to obtain insurance against that risk.\" (864 F.2d at pp. 653-654.)</p>\n<p>The <i>Fireguard</i> court also disagreed with <i>Knutson's</i> explanation of the significance of the phrase \"on behalf of the named insured\" and its absence in the endorsement. \"We think [<i>Knutson's</i>] explanation does not square with the language of the endorsement: it ignores the careful drafting that characterizes insurance policies. Moreover, neither <i>Knutson</i> nor <i>Bor-son</i> refers to the industry's interpretation of the standard form exclusion, which is strong evidence of the intent of the parties.\"<sup>[2]</sup> (864 F.2d at p. 653.)</p>\n<p>We agree with the analysis set forth in <i>Fireguard.</i> (See also <i>W.E. O'Neill Const.</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins., supra,</i> 721 F. Supp. at p. 996; see also <i>Mid-United Contr.</i> v. <i>Providence Lloyds</i> (Tex. App. 1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">754 S.W.2d 824</span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*974</span> 827; <i>Southwest La.Ct.Grain</i> v. <i>Howard A. Duncan, Inc.</i> (La. Ct. App. 1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">438 So.2d 215</span>, 224.)<sup>[3]</sup> Like the Ninth Circuit, in the absence of unambiguous policy terms we are not inclined to restrict the risks for which businesses may obtain insurance and insurers may collect premiums. Moreover, as the <i>Fireguard</i> opinion points out, rather than any ambiguity, here there is compelling evidence from the insurance industry itself that the endorsement Maryland issued was drafted as a means of covering the very risk Maryland seeks to avoid. Accordingly, like the court in <i>Fireguard,</i> we find the broad form endorsement provides coverage for damage claims growing out of services provided by subcontractors retained during development of the condominium project.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Insured's Products</i></h2>\n<p>(4) Next we consider the separate exclusion for an insured's products. Exclusion \"n\" of the Maryland policy eliminates coverage for \"property damage to the named insured's products arising out of such products or any part of such products.\" The Maryland policy defines \"named insured's products\" as \"goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name, including any container thereof [other than a vehicle], but `named insured's products' shall not include a vending machine or any property other than such container, rented to or located for use of others but not sold.\" Maryland argues the entire condominium project was its named insureds' product and thus coverage of the claims made against them is barred by the exclusion.</p>\n<p>Although Maryland's broad interpretation of the \"products exclusion\" is supported by a number of out-of-state authorities (see e.g. <i>Home Indemnity Company</i> v. <i>Miller</i> (8th Cir.1968) <span class=\"citation no-link\">399 F.2d 78</span>, 83-84; <i>Vobill Homes, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co.</i> (La. Ct. App. 1965) <span class=\"citation no-link\">179 So.2d 496</span>, 497-498; <i>Kendall Plumbing, Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation no-link\">189 Kan. 528</span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*975</span> 531-532 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">370 P.2d 396</span>, 398-399]; <i>Indiana Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Dezutti</i> (Ind. 1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\">408 N.E.2d 1275</span>, 1280; <i>Federated Service Ins.</i> v. <i>R.E.W., Inc.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Wn.App. 730</span>, 735-736 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">770 P.2d 654</span>, 657]), it has been rejected by California cases which have discussed the issue. (See <i>Economy Lumber Co.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">157 Cal. App.3d 641</span>, 650 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">204 Cal. Rptr. 135</span>]; <i>Owens Pacific Marine, Inc.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal. App.3d 661</span>, 666-668 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">90 Cal. Rptr. 826</span>] (<i>Owens Pacific Marine</i>); <i>Blackfield</i> v. <i>Underwriters at Lloyd's, London</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation no-link\">245 Cal. App.2d 271</span>, 276 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Cal. Rptr. 838</span>]; see also <i>Eichler Homes, Inc.</i> v. <i>Underwriters at Lloyd's, London</i> (1965) <span class=\"citation no-link\">238 Cal. App.2d 532</span>, 538-539 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">47 Cal. Rptr. 843</span>].) Maryland's broad definition was also rejected by the court in <i>Fireguard.</i> (864 F.2d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p>The court in <i>Owens Pacific Marine</i> conceded a products exclusion similar to Maryland's could be construed as applying to an entire boat constructed by an insured, thereby eliminating coverage for loss of the boat when a hot water heater exploded and the boat caught fire. However, after considering both out-of-state authority and California construction cases, the <i>Owens Pacific Marine</i> court found the products exclusion could also be construed as applying only to the hot water heater which failed and not to damage the water heater caused to the remainder of the boat. (12 Cal. App.3d at p. 668.) Given a reasonable interpretation of the clause which allowed coverage, the <i>Owens Pacific Marine</i> court affirmed a judgment in favor of the insured. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>)<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Fireguard</i> the insurer argued the products exclusion, identical to the one in Maryland's policy, applied to the entire sprinkler system. While acknowledging the water tank was a product, the <i>Fireguard</i> court found preparation of the water tank site was a \"service\" not covered by the exclusion. (864 F.2d at p. 654.) Thus the court refused to apply the exclusion to damage caused by errors in preparing the site or installing the tank. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>)</p>\n<p>Like the courts in <i>Owens Pacific Marine</i> and <i>Fireguard,</i> we do not accept Maryland's broad interpretation of the products exclusion. In our view such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*976</span> an interpretation, by making no distinction between \"products\" and \"work performed\" ignores the fact the policy itself makes each category of commercial activity the subject of a separate exclusion. Maryland also ignores the fact the insured contractor, DMF, probably never conveyed anything to the property owner, but rather may have acted largely as an on-site manager of goods and services provided by others. Most importantly Maryland's interpretation ignores the fact the \"work performed\" exclusion, unlike the \"products exclusion,\" was altered by the broad form endorsement to provide coverage for services supplied by subcontractors. If one exclusion was narrowed and the other was not, logic suggests there must be some difference between them. As in <i>Fireguard</i> we think the distinction arises and coverage exists when services, as opposed to discrete, tangible components, have caused injury. In this regard we note the August 1982 FC &amp; S bulletin: \"The editors have heard of instances in which insurers have denied coverage ... on the ground that the policy exclusion of injury to the named insured's <i>products</i> [orig. italics] (which is not amended by the Broad Form endorsement) eliminates coverage for any damage to the completed building, the completed building being a `product' of the named insured. In the opinion of the editors, that reasoning ignores the distinction between the `completed operations hazard' and the `named insured's products' in the policy definitions. <i>Moreover, that reasoning precludes any possibility of recovery under the Completed Operations feature of the Broad Form Endorsement, a feature for which the insured has presumably paid an additional premium.</i>\" (Italics added.) In sum, then, because the damages claimed in the underlying lawsuits may have been caused by faulty services provided to the named insureds by subcontractors, the products exclusion does not apply as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Alienated Premises</i></h2>\n<p>(5) In the trial court Maryland also argued it was entitled to summary judgment because the claims made against its insureds were within the terms of exclusion \"1\" of its policy. Exclusion \"1\" excludes coverage for \"property damage to premises alienated by the named insured arising out of such premises or any part thereof.\" This exclusion, like the work performed and products exclusions, was also discussed in the August 1982 FC &amp; S bulletin. According to the FC &amp; S bulletin, in cases such as this, where in addition to the comprehensive general liability coverage an insured has purchased a broad form endorsement: \"It is important to alert insureds \u0097 particularly those who buy land, build on it, and then sell the improved property \u0097 that the Broad Form Property Damage endorsement has no effect on the so-called Alienated Premises exclusion common to Premises <span class=\"star-pagination\">*977</span> and Operations and Completed Operations Liability insurance. That exclusion eliminates coverage for property damage to premises alienated (e.g., sold) by the named insured, if the damage arises out of such premises or any part thereof.</p>\n<p>\"Say, for example, that the named insured buys a lot and then, acting as general contractor, builds a house on the lot. If, after the house is completed and sold, a subcontractor's faulty wiring causes the house to burn and the buyer sues the named insured for the costs of repairing the house, the named insured will have no coverage under Broad Form Property Damage (including Completed Operations) endorsement, due to the Alienated Premises exclusion. By the same token, if the same named insured had not been the owner of the property but only the general contractor, he would presumably have had coverage under his Broad Form endorsement for all property damage to the house other than, perhaps, the faulty work of the subcontractor or the `particular part' of the subcontractors' work in which the fire originated.\"</p>\n<p>Thus, under the insurance industry's interpretation of Maryland's alienated premises exclusion, coverage depends upon who owned the property. As the FC &amp; S bulletin makes plain, where an insured is not an owner the exclusion does not apply. By way of a request for supplemental briefing we asked the parties to identify evidence in the record which would establish which insureds owned the property and when such insureds conveyed their interests. In response Maryland produced copies of recorded deeds which show a chain of title from Pearlman's acquisition (1972) to Gerald Frankel (1979) to Twelve Trees (in 1980) to individual buyers (between 1980 and 1985).</p>\n<p>Although we take judicial notice of the recorded deeds (Evid. Code, \u00a7 459; <i>B &amp; P Development Corp.</i> v. <i>City of Saratoga</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">185 Cal. App.3d 949</span>, 960 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">230 Cal. Rptr. 192</span>]), as to most of the insureds the deeds do not defeat coverage even under the 1982 FC &amp; S interpretation. First the deeds do not show that DMF, the contractor, or Roundtree, Ltd., the partnership, were ever owners of the property. Even with respect to Roundtree Condominiums, the joint venture, the deeds only show the joint venture appeared as a co-grantor, along with Twelve Trees, to purchasers of individual units. The deeds Maryland produced do not show the joint venture was ever granted any interest in the property. If, in fact the joint venture was never an owner of the property and its appearance on the deeds was superfluous, arguably the alienated premises exclusion would not apply to it. Thus as to DMF, Roundtree, Ltd. and the joint venture, the alienated premises exclusion would not defeat coverage as a matter of law.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> With respect to Pearlman, the deeds demonstrate the land was conveyed to him in 1972 and that he conveyed his interest in the project in 1979, before any of the Maryland policies were issued, and, the record suggests, before construction of the condominiums commenced. Given these circumstances application of the exclusion to Pearlman's prepolicy and preconstruction conveyance would likely render the policy illusory as to him. If his 1979 conveyance would defeat any coverage for the condominium project, it is difficult to understand why commencing in 1980 Maryland sold him a series of liability policies when there is no indication in the record Pearlman was involved in any other construction project.<sup>[6]</sup> Because we are counseled by general rules of contract interpretation to avoid a construction under which a contracting party receives no benefit from a contract (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1638, 1693; <i>SDR Co.</i> v. <i>Federal Ins. Co.</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">196 Cal. App.3d 1433</span>, 1437 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">242 Cal. Rptr. 534</span>]), we are unwilling to find Pearlman's 1979 conveyance gave rise to application of the alienated premises exclusion.</p>\n<p>As to Twelve Trees, which conveyed the property after the policies were issued and after construction was completed, the interpretation offered by the 1982 FC &amp; S bulletin plainly would exclude coverage. Twelve Trees would be protected for claims made during construction, but not for claims made after its conveyances. However in 1986 the alienated premises exclusion was altered to provide: \"[This insurance does not apply to ... `property damage' to] (2) Premises you sell, give away or abandon, if the property damage' arises out of any party of those premises; ... <i>Paragraph (2) of this exclusion does not apply if the premises are `your work' and were never occupied, rented, or held for rental by you.</i>\" (Italics added.) One commentator has suggested this change, which avoids any conflict with the prevailing interpretation of the broad form endorsement, was meant to clarify, rather than alter, the coverage excluded by the previous version of the alienated premises exclusion. (Gibson &amp; McLendan, Commercial Liability Insurance, International Risk Management, Inc. (1988) pp. IV.D. 14 &amp; V.E. 10-11.) Given the impact the 1982 FC &amp; S interpretation has on coverage provided by a broad form endorsement, we are inclined to agree. Having paid an additional premium for broad form coverage, we believe an insured developer would expect to receive coverage of some additional risk. Accordingly we decline to apply the exclusion to Twelve Trees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> VI</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Joint Venture</i></h2>\n<p>(6) In the trial court Maryland also relied upon a partnership and joint venture exclusion in its policies. The exclusion states: \"This insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the conduct of any partnership or joint venture of which the insured is a partner or member and which is not designated in this policy as a named insured.\" As Maryland pointed out in the trial court, the purpose of the exclusion is to protect the insurer from hidden risks it did not consider in calculating an appropriate premium. (See <i>Austin P. Keller Const.</i> v. <i>Commercial Union</i> (Minn. 1986) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1600917\"><a href=\"/opinion/1600917/austin-p-keller-const-v-commercial-union/\">379 N.W.2d 533</a></span>, 536 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">57 A.L.R.4th 1147</span>].)</p>\n<p>Maryland argues that all the damage claimed by the homeowners arose out of the conduct of the Roundtree Condominium joint venture and that the joint venture is not named on any of the policies which include a broad form endorsement. However our review of two of the policies with the broad form endorsement discloses the insureds are identified as \"Roundtree Ltd., a California partnership, &amp; DMF Construction, Inc., A Joint Venture.\" Whether this inartful reference to \"a joint venture\" was intended or sufficient to provide Maryland with notice of the risks posed by the condominium project is a matter we cannot resolve on this record. Resolution of that question may turn upon who was responsible for providing such a description of the named insureds, whether Maryland had other notice that its insureds were doing business as a joint venture, and perhaps most importantly, whether the joint venture form of doing business adopted by the insureds materially altered Maryland's risk. (See <i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Imperial Contracting Co., supra,</i> 212 Cal. App.3d at p. 725.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Because claims for property damage were made against the named insureds and none of the exclusions Maryland relied upon eliminate coverage as a matter of law, the summary judgment entered in Maryland's favor must be reversed.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed; appellants to recover their costs.</p>\n<p>Huffman, J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>Respondent's petition for reiview by the Supreme Court was denied September 19, 1990.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Geddes</i> the policy covered damages \"`because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 563.) The court found that \"property\" as used in the policy \"refers to physical or tangible property.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 566.)</p>\n<p>[2]  At oral argument Maryland pointed out that in relying on the FC &amp; S bulletin the court in <i>Fireguard</i> was employing Oregon law which permits use of extrinsic evidence even when contract language is not ambiguous. (<i>Fireguard, supra,</i> 864 F.2d at p. 651.) However, under California law reliance on the FC &amp; S bulletin is appropriate under Civil Code section 1645 which provides: \"Technical words are to be interpreted as usually understood by persons in the profession or business to which they relate, unless clearly used in a different sense.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  We note the <i>Fireguard</i> opinion was decided on December 27, 1988, and hence was not available to the trial court at the time judgment in favor of Maryland was entered.</p>\n<p>[4]  As we have noted some of the Maryland policies do not have a broad form endorsement. Under our holding in <i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Imperial Contracting Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">212 Cal. App.3d 712</span>, 723-724, those policies would not provide coverage for damage to work performed by or on behalf of the developers or contractors. However, in its notice of motion Maryland did not identify the coverage provided by particular policies as discrete issues on which it was seeking summary adjudication. Thus we do not have the power to direct the trial court to enter an order in Maryland's favor as to the coverage provided by particular policies. (See <i>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co.</i> v. <i>Sogomonian</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">198 Cal. App.3d 169</span>, 186 [243 Cal.Rptr 639]; Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (1989) \u00a7\u00a7 10:41-10:45.)</p>\n<p>[5]  The exclusion in <i>Owens Pacific Marine</i> excluded property damage to \"`any goods [or] products ... sold, handled or distributed ... by the named insured, or work completed by or for the named insured, out of which the accident arises.'\" (12 Cal. App.3d at p. 665.) As the Maryland policies demonstrate, the work performed and product exclusions are now separate exclusions, thus eliminating any ambiguity when no broad form endorsement has been purchased. In the absence of the endorsement the work performed exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage for damage to any part of the goods or services provided by a general contractor or developer. (<i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Imperial Contracting Co., supra,</i> 212 Cal. App.3d at pp. 723-724; <i>Western Employers Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Arciero &amp; Sons, Inc., supra,</i> 146 Cal. App.3d at p. 1031.)</p>\n<p>[6]  We note that in its supplemental brief Maryland relies on <i>Rieder</i> v. <i>Cherokee Ins. Co.</i> (E.D.Pa. 1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">635 F. Supp. 699</span>, 700-702 (<i>Rieder</i>). In <i>Rieder</i> the court upheld application of the alienated premises exclusion where conveyance of a completed apartment project occurred before the subject policy was issued. Unlike the situation here, however, in <i>Rieder</i> there is no indication the insured was seeking protection solely for the very project which it had previously conveyed.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Court of Appeal below concluded that allegations of incidental emotional distress damages flowing from noncovered causes of action fall outside the scope of a commercial (formerly called comprehensive) general liability (CGL) policy and present no potential for coverage under the policy. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal reasoned, because there is no potential for coverage, there is no duty to defend on the part of the insurer. (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.2d 263</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal. Rptr. 104</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">419 P.2d 168</span>] [hereafter <i>Gray</i>].) The Court of Appeal also concluded that if the insurer is under no obligation to defend or indemnify the third party action, it cannot be found liable for either statutory bad faith (Ins. Code, \u00a7 790.03) or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for its denial of a defense. (See, e.g., <i>Love</i> v. <i>Fire Ins. Exchange</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.3d 1136</span>, 1152 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">271 Cal. Rptr. 246</span>] [bad faith claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due].) As we explain, we affirm the Court of Appeal judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTS</h2>\n<p>In 1985, defendant Truck Insurance Exchange, Inc. (hereafter T.I.E.) issued a CGL policy to plaintiff Marmac, Inc., a California corporation that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> provides engineering and design services to aerospace, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. The declarations page of the T.I.E. policy identified Marmac as the named insured, and contained an endorsement naming Lester Amey, among others, as a named insured. The policy was renewed in 1986, and was substantially identical (with typographical corrections) to the 1985 policy.</p>\n<p>In pertinent part, the T.I.E. policy provided liability coverage for: \"all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of ... bodily injury to any person, and ... damage to property ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\" The policy did not provide personal injury coverage to Marmac directors and officers and specifically excluded coverage for any insured for bodily injury to a named insured. The policy defined an \"occurrence\" \"as an event, or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by the act or omission which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers), as T.I.E.'s adjuster, was responsible for handling claims filed by T.I.E. insureds.</p>\n<p>Prior to August 29, 1986, plaintiff Waller, Marmac's president, owned 60 percent of Marmac stock. Amey, Marmac's executive vice-president, owned 40 percent. On August 29, 1986, Waller sold his stock in equal proportions to employees Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple. Thereafter, Waller resigned from Marmac's board, and Hendrix and Hepple were elected to the board, with Amey remaining as the third member. Akers subsequently became president of the company, and Hendrix, Hepple and Petersen became vice-presidents. Amey was thereafter demoted.</p>\n<p>Amey sued Marmac, Waller, and the four Marmac officers under 11 causes of action: involuntary dissolution (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1800, subd. (b)(4) &amp; (5)); breach of fiduciary duty; breach of statutory duty of good faith (<i>id.,</i> \u00a7 309); interference with prospective economic advantage; breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; inducing breach of contract; conspiracy; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and injunctive relief. The first amended complaint included allegations that Marmac's board of directors was \"guilty of or have knowingly countenanced acts of persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority and persistent unfairness toward Amey,\" and that they excluded \"Amey from any voice in the management [of Marmac]\" to deprive him of a controlling block of stock in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> the corporation and in order to \"gain a controlling interest in and to freeze Amey, a minority shareholder, out of the corporation.\" Amey also accused the management of Marmac of \"self-dealing in voting themselves substantial increases in salary, and causing [Marmac] to enter into an unreasonable or sham contract of employment with [Waller].\"</p>\n<p>Amey also accused Waller of disregarding and breaching his fiduciary duties to Amey, failing \"to exercise good faith and due care so as to avoid unfairness to [Amey] by entering into a transaction to dispose of his dominant or control block of stock in [Marmac] without the slightest regard to the wishes and interests, and without prior knowledge of [Amey], and for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the sale or transfer of said controlling block of shares.\"</p>\n<p>Amey's 10th cause of action alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress against Waller and the Marmac officers, and claimed that because of their conduct, Amey \"suffered humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\" Amey alleged that as fiduciaries, Waller and the Marmac officers' conduct leading up to the involuntary dissolution and wrongful termination as alleged in the complaint \"was outrageous, went beyond all reasonable bounds of decency, was intentional and malicious and was done for the purpose of causing [Amey] to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\" In making these allegations, Amey did not include Marmac as a named defendant, but nonetheless incorporated all allegations of corporate misconduct and financial detriment into the cause of action.</p>\n<p>One week after the Amey suit was filed, Robert Kull, Marmac's corporate attorney, wrote T.I.E. at its home office requesting the insurer defend the Amey lawsuit on behalf of all defendants. About three weeks latter, the letter was forwarded to Farmers' regional liability claims manager in Santa Ana. The claims manager sought an in-house coverage opinion, but did not act on the defense question. That issue was forwarded to Farmers' Anaheim branch claims office. Richard Neisser, manager of the Anaheim office, tentatively concluded that the complaint alleged a noncovered business dispute. He discussed the matter with William Vaughter, a claims representative, and instructed Vaughter to investigate the loss and to verify whether the Amey complaint had been served. Vaughter told Hendrix around December 10 or 11, 1986, that he was going to process the claim for payment. According to Hendrix, Vaughter then asked whether he was pleased with his counsel because Farmers could provide counsel if he was not.</p>\n<p>On December 29, 1986, the insureds forwarded to Vaughter the total billing (in the amount of $54,000) for attorney fees incurred in defending <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> the Amey lawsuit. Neisser directed Vaughter to (1) \"transmit to [in house counsel] after you have called and discussed, among other things, whether the insurer owes a defense and whether there is an obligation under [<i>San Diego Federal Credit Union</i> v. <i>Cumis Ins. Society, Inc.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">162 Cal. App.3d 358</span>, 364 (<span class=\"citation no-link\">208 Cal. Rptr. 494</span>)], (2) send a reservation of rights letter and (3) make up an office file.\" Neisser concluded, based on the allegations of the complaint, that the policy did not provide coverage for Amey's claims. Neisser then instructed Vaughter to contact in-house counsel, who advised Vaughter to deny the claim. Neisser prepared an evaluation recommending \"no coverage.\"</p>\n<p>The regional claims manager (Eastman) concurred in Neisser's decision that the CGL policy did not provide coverage under the allegations of the Amey complaint. Eastman based his decision on the following factors: (1) Amey's complaint did not state an occurrence within the policy insuring clause because Amey was not claiming bodily injury or property damage, and any economic injuries he suffered were expected or intended from the standpoint of the insureds; (2) the policy endorsement listed Amey as a named insured and the policy expressly excluded coverage for liability to named insureds; and (3) Amey was a Marmac employee, and the policy excluded coverage for bodily injury suffered by Marmac employees arising out of and in the course of employment. Eastman testified that the amount of attorney fees already incurred did not influence his decision to recommend a denial of coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p>In January 1987, Eastman directed Neisser: \"Please deny the insureds' request with an appropriate response outlining specifically that since no coverage is available under the policy contract, nothing can be considered as far as any payment is concerned.\" Neisser sent the insureds the following denial letter:</p>\n<p>\"We have received your claim for attorney fees in the Lester H. Amey v. Marmac [case]. Accordingly, we have reviewed your policy in its entirety, spoken to your agent, obtained the opinion of our house counsel and submitted the entire packet of information to our Regional Office for a decision regarding whether this loss is covered under your policy.</p>\n<p>\"The claim against Marmac is essentially a shareholder dispute regarding intentional acts committed by Marmac and their principles [<i>sic</i>]. Intentional Acts are not covered under your Sentinel business policy or any endorsements taken out by Marmac. Accordingly we are unable to make payment for legal expenses incurred by Marmac in this matter.\"</p>\n<p>Marmac's counsel asked for reconsideration of the denial, asserting that Amey's amended complaint created a potential for coverage under the CGL <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> policy. The request was forwarded to the regional office, and the office confirmed the \"no coverage\" decision. Thereafter, Waller, Marmac, and the Marmac officers successfully defended the Amey action.</p>\n<p>Between May and August of 1987, Waller, Marmac, and the four individual defendants filed separate lawsuits against T.I.E. and Farmers, alleging causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation. All plaintiffs sought both compensatory and punitive damages. Waller amended his pleading to substitute Farmers, Farmers Group, Inc., and Truck Underwriters Association for several Does. (Waller later dismissed the latter two entities from his complaint.) Marmac and the other plaintiffs amended their pleadings to substitute Farmers as a party. Two years later the three actions were consolidated and the parties filed second amended complaints, the subject of this proceeding. Only Waller's second amended complaint alleged a cause of action for statutory bad faith pursuant to Insurance Code section 790.03. Marmac, Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple amended their complaints to include a section 790.03 cause of action following the close of evidence at trial.</p>\n<p>After the trial court denied a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by T.I.E. and Farmers, the parties tried the legal issues to the court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 592.) The court ruled that (1) Amey's first amended complaint \"alleges facts potentially within bodily injury coverage\" of the T.I.E. policy; (2) as a matter of law, \"the occurrence clause in [the policy] gives rise to a duty to defend in this case\"; (3) T.I.E.'s letter to Marmac denying coverage \"waived policy based defenses not specified therein\"; and (4) Insurance Code section 533, disallowing coverage for the insured's \"willful\" acts, did not excuse T.I.E. from its duty to defend under the policy. The trial court concluded: \"[T]he logical conclusions of all the findings made so far, [is that] as a matter of law you had a duty to defend.\"</p>\n<p>Following plaintiffs' opening statements in the jury trial, the trial court granted motions for nonsuit filed by T.I.E. and Farmers on the following causes of action: breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, deceit and negligent misrepresentation, as well as claims by Marmac and Hendrix, Petersen, Akers, and Hepple regarding allegations that T.I.E.'s failure to defend the Amey lawsuit prejudiced their defense.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted plaintiffs' motions for partial directed verdict that T.I.E. breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that Farmers was jointly and severally liable with T.I.E. for the breach.</p>\n<p>After concluding that both T.I.E. and Farmers violated Insurance Code section 790.03, the jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> following approximate amounts: to Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple, the jury awarded $89,000 for the cost of defending the Amey lawsuit. Marmac received contract damages in the amount of $349,000 and attorney fees in the amount of $390,000. (See <i>Brandt</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">37 Cal.3d 813</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">210 Cal. Rptr. 211</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">693 P.2d 796</span>] [allowing attorney fees for tortious breach of insurance contract].) The jury awarded Waller contract damages of $144,000, attorney fees of $334,000, lost consulting fees of $227,500 and emotional distress damages of $250,000.</p>\n<p>After originally being deadlocked on the punitive damages issue, the jury returned a nine-to-three verdict in favor of such damages. It awarded Waller $27 million in punitive damages against Farmers, and $3 million in punitive damages against T.I.E. Marmac received punitive damages totaling $26 million, and Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple received a total of $4 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>On motions for new trial filed by T.I.E. and Farmers, the court ordered the judgment corrected to eliminate Farmers' liability for policy benefits. The court also ruled that the punitive damages awarded to Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple were excessive.</p>\n<p>Both T.I.E. and Farmers appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the entire judgment after concluding that T.I.E.'s CGL policy did not provide coverage under the allegations of the Amey complaint. The Court of Appeal concluded that because Amey's alleged emotional and physical distress flowed from noncovered economic loss, there was no potential for coverage and hence no duty to defend the plaintiffs against the Amey lawsuit. The Court of Appeal summarized its holding as follows: \"Clearly, the Amey lawsuit sets forth nothing more than a business dispute; the torts alleged in the suit are all business and contract transgressions. Simply put, the gravamen of the Amey lawsuit is economic loss. In our view, the damages claim for emotional and physical distress is clearly derivative of and caused by the economic loss suffered by Amey.\"</p>\n<p>We conclude the Court of Appeal correctly analyzed the duty to defend and coverage issues under authority from our state and federal courts. Moreover, the finding of no duty to defend in this context is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties when they enter into a contract for commercial general liability insurance, for it is widely understood by both insureds and insurers that such policies are not intended to cover economic losses. As we explain, the damages alleged in Amey's complaint flowed from intangible property losses that could not be considered covered occurrences under the CGL policy. Likewise, the derivative emotional distress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> damages sought by Amey for the plaintiffs' alleged business torts were not covered because they flowed from the same noncovered acts. Any damages flowing from noncovered losses that may lead to emotional distress cannot be used to expand coverage where none was intended or bargained for by the parties. (<i>Keating</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins.</i> (9th Cir.1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">995 F.2d 154</span>, 156-157 [hereafter <i>Keating</i>]; <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Cal. App.4th 1132</span>, 1150-1151 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. Rptr.2d 559</span>] [hereafter <i>McLaughlin</i>].) We begin our analysis with an explanation of a third party CGL policy and its intended coverage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Commercial General Liability Policy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(1) In pertinent part, a CGL policy, often referred to as a business general liability policy, provides liability insurance for businesses. The policy is written in two essential parts: the insuring agreement, which states the risk or risks covered by the policy, and the exclusion clauses, which remove coverage for risks that would otherwise fall within the insuring clause. (<i>Collin</i> v. <i>American Empire Ins. Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Cal. App.4th 787</span>, 802 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Cal. Rptr.2d 391</span>].) Before \"even considering exclusions, a court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether a claim falls within [the policy terms].\" (<i>Hallmark Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">201 Cal. App.3d 1014</span>, 1017 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">247 Cal. Rptr. 638</span>].) \"This is significant for two reasons. First, `... when an occurrence is clearly not included within the coverage afforded by the insuring clause, it need not also be specifically excluded.' (<i>Glavinich</i> v. <i>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">163 Cal. App.3d 263</span>, 270 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">209 Cal. Rptr. 266</span>].)</p>\n<p>\"Second, although exclusions are construed narrowly and must be proven by the insurer, the burden is on the insured to bring the claim within the basic scope of coverage, and (unlike exclusions) courts will not indulge in a forced construction of the policy's insuring clause to bring a claim within the policy's coverage.\" (<i>Collin</i> v. <i>American Empire Ins. Co., supra,</i> 21 Cal. App.4th at p. 803.) Accordingly, the insured has the burden of showing that there has been an \"occurrence\" within the terms of the policy. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>(2) The CGL policy restricts coverage to damages \"caused by an occurrence,\" which, in standard pre-1986 policies, was defined as an \"accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Although more recent policies (including T.I.E.'s policy) have replaced the term \"accident\" with \"event\" (to include gradual events within the concept of accident), the phrase \"neither expected nor intended\" focuses coverage on <i>unexpected</i> or <i>accidental injuries</i> that are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> fortuitous and not planned or intended. This concept of fortuity is basic to insurance law. (<i>Chu</i> v. <i>Canadian Indemnity Co.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">224 Cal. App.3d 86</span>, 94-95 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">274 Cal. Rptr. 20</span>] (<i>Chu</i>).) Insurance typically is designed to protect against contingent or unknown risks of harm (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 250), not to protect against harm that is certain or expected. (<i>Chu, supra,</i> 224 Cal. App.3d at pp. 94-95.) In other words, such insurance generally protects against risks of loss rather than certainties of loss. (<i>Ibid.</i>; see e.g., <i>Shell Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal. App.4th 715</span>, 747 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">15 Cal. Rptr.2d 815</span>] [the phrase \"expected or intended\" precludes coverage for damage that the insured subjectively intended to be a result of its conduct, as well as damage that it in fact subjectively foresaw as practically certain to be a result of its conduct].)</p>\n<p>(3) Standard CGL policies define bodily injury to mean: \"bodily injury, sickness or disease [including death at any time resulting therefrom] sustained by any person.\" (3 Keller &amp; Golub, Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1995) ch. 49, General Liability Policies, \u00a7 49.14[1], pp. 49-27 to 49-28.)</p>\n<p>The property loss section of the standard policy provides coverage for \"physical injury or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy term.\" The focus of coverage for property damage is therefore the property itself, and does not include intangible economic losses, violation of antitrust laws or nonperformance of contractual obligations. (See, e.g., <i>Gulf Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>L.A. Effects Group, Inc.</i> (9th Cir.1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">827 F.2d 574</span>, 578 [no coverage under business general liability policy for insured's alleged nonperformance of contractual obligations to create special visual effects for motion picture]; <i>Lassen Canyon Nursery</i> v. <i>Royal Ins. Co. of America</i> (9th Cir.1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">720 F.2d 1016</span>, 1018 [business liability policy for property damage does not cover claims for strictly economic losses caused by insured's alleged antitrust violations]; <i>Montrose Chemical Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">6 Cal.4th 287</span>, 303 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. Rptr.2d 467</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">861 P.2d 1153</span>] [recognizing that \"a suit seeking recovery for injuries to intangible economic interests is not a suit `of the nature and kind' covered by a CGL policy\"]; <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">13 Cal.

App.3d 213</span>, 217 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. Rptr. 278</span>] [hereafter <i>Giddings</i>] [no coverage for intangible economic interests, including breach of securities laws and fraud].) As <i>Giddings</i> observed, \"strictly economic losses like lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of the anticipated benefit of a bargain, and loss of an investment, do not constitute damage or injury to tangible property covered by a comprehensive general liability policy. [Citations.] A complaint seeking to recover damages of this nature from an insured falls within <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> the scope of the insurance coverage only where these intangible economic losses provide `a measure of damages to physical property which is within the policy's coverage.' [Citations].\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 219.)</p>\n<p>Finally, by statute, and as a matter of public policy, the insurer may not provide coverage for willful injuries by the insured against a third party. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 533.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Interpretation of Insurance Contracts</i></h2>\n<p>(4) When determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend, we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. (<i>AIU Ins. Co</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 Cal.3d 807</span>, 818 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">274 Cal. Rptr. 820</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">799 P.2d 1253</span>] [hereafter <i>AIU</i>].) The rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638; <i>Reserve Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Pisciotta</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation no-link\">30 Cal.3d 800</span>, 807 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">180 Cal. Rptr. 628</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">640 P.2d 764</span>] [hereafter <i>Reserve Insurance</i>].) Thus, in determining whether allegations in a particular complaint give rise to coverage under a CGL policy, courts must consider both the occurrence language in the policy, and the endorsements broadening coverage, if any, included in the policy terms. (<i>Collin</i> v. <i>American Empire Ins. Co., supra,</i> 21 Cal. App.4th at p. 803.)</p>\n<p>The fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the \"mutual intention\" of the parties. \"Under statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 1639.) The `clear and explicit' meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their `ordinary and popular sense,' unless `used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage' (<i>id.,</i> \u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 1638.)\" (<i>AIU, supra,</i> 51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822; <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th 1254</a></span>, 1264-1265 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. Rptr.2d 538</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">833 P.2d 545</span>] [hereafter <i>Bank of the West</i>].) A policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. (<i>Bay Cities Paving Grading, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lawyers' Mutual Insurance Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113495/bay-cities-paving-grading-v-lawyersmutual-ins/\">5 Cal.4th 854</a></span>, 867 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Cal. Rptr.2d 691</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">855 P.2d 1263</span>].) But language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. (<i>Bank of the West, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 2 Cal.4th at p. 1265.) Courts will not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> strain to create an ambiguity where none exists. (<i>Reserve Insurance, supra,</i> 30 Cal.3d at p. 807.)</p>\n<p>These well-established precepts of insurance coverage guide us in our determination of whether a particular policy requires a liability insurer to defend a lawsuit filed by a third party against the insured. (5) It has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276; see also <i>Montrose Chemical Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 6 Cal.4th at p. 295.) This duty, which applies even to claims that are \"groundless, false, or fraudulent,\" is separate from and broader than the insurer's duty to indemnify. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at pp. 273-275.) However, \"`where there is no possibility of coverage, there is no duty to defend....'\" (<i>Fire Ins. Exchange</i> v. <i>Abbott</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">204 Cal. App.3d 1012</span>, 1029 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">251 Cal. Rptr. 620</span>].) <i>Gray</i> and its progeny have made it clear that the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276; <i>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club Inc.</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611826\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611826/la-jolla-beach-tennis-club-v-industrial-indemnity/\">9 Cal.4th 27</a></span>, 44 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">36 Cal. Rptr.2d 100</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">884 P.2d 1048</span>] [test is whether underlying action for which defense is sought potentially seeks relief within policy terms].)</p>\n<p>Conversely, where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage, the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability. (<i>Saylin</i> v. <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">179 Cal. App.3d 256</span>, 263 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">224 Cal. Rptr. 493</span>]; <i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Flynt</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal. App.3d 538</span>, 548-549 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">95 Cal. Rptr. 296</span>].) This is because the duty to defend, although broad, is not unlimited; it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 274; <i>Giddings, supra,</i> 112 Cal. App.3d at p. 218.) With these principles in mind, we proceed with our discussion of T.I.E.'s duties to plaintiffs under its CGL policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>T.I.E.'s Duty to Defend</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(6) The T.I.E. CGL policy insuring language was standard. The company agreed to \"pay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of ... bodily injury to any person, and ... damage to property ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\" Bodily injury was defined as \"sickness or disease\" and property damage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> meant \"physical injury or destruction of tangible property.\" The T.I.E. policy also contained the standard exclusions for \"bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured,\" and for \"the liability of any insured for bodily injury to ... the named insured.\"</p>\n<p>The policy defined \"occurrence\" to mean \"an event, or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by the act or omission which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Thus, to demonstrate a potential for coverage under T.I.E.'s policy, an insured must show the claim he must defend is an alleged act or omission that caused bodily injury or tangible property damage (as defined by the policy) to the third party, and that the alleged injury was neither expected nor intended by the insured.</p>\n<p>The first issue we address is whether, under the insuring language and definitions of the liability policy, T.I.E. owed a duty to defend plaintiffs against Amey's lawsuit based on the fact that T.I.E.'s CGL policy provided coverage for \"property damage\" and \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence.\"</p>\n<p>In reversing the trial court judgment, the Court of Appeal focused on the fact that Amey's complaint alleged emotional and physical distress flowing from an uncovered economic loss. The appellate court found no duty to defend the underlying lawsuit because the \"gravamen\" of the complaint was economic loss. It found the damages for emotional and physical distress were derivative of and inseparable from Amey's allegations of intentional and business torts, allegations that could not, by themselves, give rise to coverage under a CGL policy.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal relied principally on three cases (including two cases decided after the trial in the present matter) to conclude that T.I.E. had no duty to defend the Amey action because plaintiffs' alleged misconduct (as asserted in the Amey complaint) was not potentially covered by the T.I.E. policy. (<i>Keating, supra,</i> 995 F.2d at pp. 156-157; <i>McLaughlin, supra,</i> 23 Cal. App.4th at pp. 1150-1151; <i>Chatton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Keating, supra,</i> the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the issue whether, under California law, an insurer had a duty to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> defend its insureds against an investor action alleging that the insureds' conduct in committing securities fraud and other related claims had caused the plaintiff investors to suffer economic damages that, in turn, resulted in their suffering from \"`emotional and physical distress, and impairment of health.'\" (995 F.2d at p. 156.) The court held the insurer owed no duty to defend the underlying investor lawsuits because the alleged emotional and physical distress flowed from economic losses, which were not covered by the CGL policy and therefore did not give rise to a duty to defend. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>The <i>Keating</i> court relied on <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Interbank Financial Services</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. App.3d 825</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">264 Cal. Rptr. 25</span>] (hereafter <i>Allstate</i>), which denied coverage under a CGL policy for bodily injury in a lawsuit alleging that an investment firm had conspired to convince third party plaintiffs to make unsound investments. In reaching its conclusion, the <i>Allstate</i> court held that \"[t]he [liability] policy covers losses resulting from accidental events which cause bodily injury or property damage, not the giving of professional or investment advice.... Here, although the insureds attempt to characterize the claims differently, the clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice and the plaintiffs lost money in a tax shelter investment. [\u00b6] Had these insureds desired to obtain a professional liability policy to protect them from charges resulting from the performance of professional services, such insurance could have been obtained [at a higher premium].... [J]ust as an insurer would not reasonably expect that a [CGL] policy would cover claims for securities fraud, these insureds could not reasonably expect that such claims would be covered under this policy.\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 830-831.)</p>\n<p>As in <i>Allstate, supra,</i> 215 Cal. App.3d at pages 830-831, the <i>Keating</i> court recognized that economic or business loss \"of the sort alleged by the investors\" is not a covered loss within the meaning of a standard CGL policy. Nor, in the <i>Keating</i> court's view, is emotional and physical distress induced by (or derivative of) the economic loss a covered event. As the court observed, \"It would expand coverage of these policies far beyond any reasonable expectation of the parties to sweep within their potential coverage any alleged emotional or physical distress that might result from economic loss that is itself clearly outside the scope of the policy.\" (<i>Keating, supra,</i> 995 F.2d at p. 156.) For this latter statement, the <i>Keating</i> court relied on <i>Chatton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, a coverage case that is nonetheless applicable to our duty to defend discussion because the court concluded that a CGL policy does not provide a potential for coverage for allegations based on economic losses and emotional distress flowing from those losses. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 857.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Chatton,</i> several investors sued the directors and officers of Technical Equities, an investment services company, for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The investors prevailed on their negligence and fraud causes of action and were awarded damages for both their economic losses and resulting emotional distress, as well as punitive damages. Following their success at trial, the investors filed a declaratory relief action against the company's liability insurer to adjudicate coverage. The trial court held, among other things, that there was coverage under the bodily injury clause because the investors' emotional distress constituted \"bodily injury\" under the CGL policy, and that the wrongful activities of Technical Equities (i.e., security manipulations, note fraud, etc.) were \"occurrences\" within the meaning of the same policy.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that any emotional distress suffered by the investors due to their economic losses was not covered by the liability policy even though those losses were caused by the negligent misrepresentations of Technical Equities officers and directors. (See <i>Warner</i> v. <i>Fire Ins. Exchange</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">230 Cal. App.3d 1029</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">281 Cal. Rptr. 635</span>]; <i>Allstate, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. App.3d 825</span>; <i>Giddings, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App.3d 213</span>; <i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.</i> (1977) <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Cal. App.3d 272</span>, 279 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">142 Cal. Rptr. 681</span>].) This is so, the court held, because the \"bodily injury\" clause under a CGL policy \"provides coverage for bodily injury to the person and for physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, <i>tangible property.</i>\" (<i>Chatton, supra,</i> 10 Cal. App.4th at p. 857, some italics omitted.) Recognizing that the investors' emotional distress claims were \"predicated upon the `bodily injury' clause of the CGL policy,\" the court concluded that the emotional trauma suffered by the investors was caused by investment or <i>intangible</i> economic losses which, in turn, were caused by the negligent misrepresentations of the Technical Equities officers. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 860.) The emotional trauma, the court concluded, fell outside the coverage clauses of the CGL policy. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 858.)</p>\n<p>The present Court of Appeal also relied on <i>McLaughlin, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Cal. App.4th 1132</span>, 1150, another case involving Technical Equities officers and directors, decided after the <i>Keating</i> and <i>Chatton</i> cases. One issue in <i>McLaughlin</i> was whether the insurer had a duty to defend against an action alleging that the insureds' conduct had caused the investor plaintiffs to suffer economic damages and resultant mental, physical and emotional distress. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>) The <i>McLaughlin</i> court followed the reasoning of <i>Keating, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608200\"><a href=\"/opinion/608200/charles-h-keating-jr-andrew-ligget-charles-a-keating-iii-robert/\">995 F.2d 154</a></span>, and <i>Chatton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, to reverse a multimillion-dollar, bad faith judgment against Technical Equities's insurer, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., and to conclude the insurer owed no duty to defend under the bodily injury and property damage clauses because none of the damages sought was allowed under the CGL policy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> The <i>McLaughlin</i> court observed, \"[p]laintiffs' physical and emotional distress derived from their investment loss which in turn was negligently inflicted upon them by the insureds. First, the property damage coverage under the CGL extends only to physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, `tangible property.' Damage for lost profits, loss of investment or other harm to one's economic interest constitute injuries to <i>intangible</i> property which by definition fall outside the scope of the [CGL] policy. (<i>Chatton, supra,</i> 10 Cal. App.4th at pp. 857-858.) [\u00b6] Second, since [p]laintiffs' physical distress was induced by an uncovered economic loss it defies reason that bodily injury coverage would nevertheless independently obtain.\" (<i>McLaughlin, supra,</i> 23 Cal. App.4th at p. 1150, italics in original.)</p>\n<p>We agree with the Court of Appeal below that <i>Keating, Chatton,</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> properly determined that CGL policies do not provide coverage for economic losses that cause emotional distress. As we have observed, the CGL policy provides coverage for \"occurrences\" that cause bodily injury or tangible property losses. (<i>Giddings, supra,</i> 112 Cal. App.3d at p. 217.) These policies were never intended to cover emotional distress damages that flow from an uncovered \"occurrence,\" and the parties could not reasonably have expected that coverage would be expanded merely because a claim of emotional or physical distress is alleged as a result of the economic loss. (<i>Keating, supra,</i> 995 F.2d at p. 157, fn.1.) Accordingly, when we apply this rule to the present case and look to the allegations of the Amey complaint compared with the terms of T.I.E.'s CGL policy, we conclude that T.I.E. owed no duty to defend the Amey lawsuit. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) All allegations in the Amey complaint were related to Amey's asserted <i>economic loss</i> as a Marmac shareholder, and, as T.I.E. noted in its denial letter, shareholder disputes are not covered by its policy. In sum, the allegations of the Amey complaint, liberally construed, did not assert a risk potentially covered under T.I.E.'s CGL policy. Nonetheless, plaintiffs make several procedural arguments urging this court to recognize a duty to defend based on the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p>(7) First, plaintiffs contend that T.I.E. and Farmers should not be allowed to rely on either <i>Keating</i> or <i>McLaughlin,</i> or their theory of no coverage for economic losses, because those cases were not decided until after the trial in the present matter was complete. Moreover, plaintiffs contend the \"economic loss\" issue cannot be considered because it was not raised in the trial court or in the regular briefing in the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p>Both arguments fail. As T.I.E. and Farmers observe, Courts of Appeal routinely consider newly published case law that was not available until after entry of judgment in the trial court. (See, e.g., <i>Hattersley</i> v. <i>American</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> <i>Nucleonics Corp.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">3 Cal. App.4th 397</span>, 402 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal. Rptr.2d 331</span>] [rejecting claim that appellant should be foreclosed from relying on theory of law espoused in newly decided Court of Appeal opinion]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29.3(a) [\"When a party desires to present new authorities ... not available in time to have been included in the party's brief on the merits, the party may serve and file a supplemental brief....\"].)</p>\n<p>Moreover, after the <i>Keating</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> cases were decided, T.I.E. (and Farmers) sought, and obtained permission, to file supplemental briefs. As the Court of Appeal observed, supplemental briefing is proper when a court wishes to consider a point of law following the regular briefing of a case on appeal. (See <i>Meier</i> v. <i>Ross General Hospital</i> (1968) <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Cal.2d 420</span>, 423-424, fn. 1 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">71 Cal. Rptr. 903</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">445 P.2d 519</span>]; <i>Kievlan</i> v. <i>Dahlberg Electronics, Inc.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">78 Cal. App.3d 951</span>, 957, fn. 5 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">144 Cal. Rptr. 585</span>].)</p>\n<p>Second, as T.I.E., Farmers, and the Court of Appeal observe, the duty to defend issue involves a question of law based on undisputed facts. Under settled law, the Court of Appeal had discretion to address the issue even though it had not been raised in the trial court. (<i>Canaan</i> v. <i>Abelnour</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">40 Cal.3d 703</span>, 733, fn. 17 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. Rptr. 468</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">710 P.2d 268</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 A.L.R.4th 915</span>]; see <i>Ward</i> v. <i>Taggart</i> (1959) <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 Cal.2d 736</span>, 742 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">336 P.2d 534</span>] [new theory pertaining to question of law on facts appearing in the record may be raised for the first time on appeal].)</p>\n<p>In a related context, plaintiffs assert the Court of Appeal should not have applied <i>Keating</i> or <i>McLaughlin</i> \"retroactively\" because both cases represent new law that should not be used to justify T.I.E.'s denial of a defense to the Amey action. Plaintiffs also claim that any uncertainty on legal questions of policy interpretation compels a defense of a third party lawsuit until the issue is resolved by controlling authority.</p>\n<p>These claims ignore the general rule that judicial decisions are to be applied retroactively.

The <i>Harper</i> court found unmeritorious the argument that a court should consider the equities of each individual case in deciding the question of retroactivity. (Cf. <i>Newman</i> v. <i>Emerson Radio Corp., supra,</i> 48 Cal.3d at pp. 986-987.) Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Keating</i> was not new law; rather it was a clarification of the law as it existed when plaintiffs tendered their defense to T.I.E. Thus, T.I.E. may rely on <i>Keating</i> to defend the position it took at the time of tender, and its position here, that there was no possibility of coverage under the facts alleged or otherwise known to T.I.E. Indeed, the <i>Keating</i> decision was but a logical extension of the principle, well established at the time T.I.E. denied a defense in the Amey action (see e.g., <i>Lassen Canyon Nursery, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">720 F.2d 1016</span>, 1018; <i>Giddings, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App.3d 213</span>, 219; <i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Cal.

Plaintiffs misinterpret <i>CNA Casualty of California</i> v. <i>Seaboard Surety Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">176 Cal. App.3d 598</span>, 605 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">222 Cal. Rptr. 276</span>] (hereafter <i>CNA Casualty</i>) (criticized on other grounds in <i>Montrose</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 6 Cal.4th at pp. 297, 298). <i>CNA Casualty</i> held that: \"An insurer's duty to defend must be analyzed and determined on the basis of any <i>potential</i> liability arising from facts available to the insurer from the complaint or other sources available to it at the time of the tender of defense.\" (176 Cal. App.3d at p. 605, italics in original.) As the Court of Appeal below observed, <i>CNA Casualty</i> simply recites the settled rule that the insurer must look to the facts of the complaint and extrinsic evidence, if available, to determine whether there is a potential for coverage under the policy and a corresponding duty to defend. <i>CNA Casualty</i> does not hold, as plaintiffs suggest, that the insurer must always defend a third party lawsuit absent a published judicial opinion definitively construing the specific policy provision on which the insurer relies, or, as plaintiffs assert, \"until the extent of `the policy coverage' is legally certain,\" to deny the defense. This has never been the law. (See, e.g., <i>McLaughlin, supra,</i> 23 Cal. App.4th at p. 1152 [duty to defend depends on facts in complaint; where only potential for liability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> turns on resolution of legal question, there is no duty to defend]; citing <i>State Farm Mut.

Rptr. 726</span>].)</p>\n<p>As plaintiffs themselves observe, the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) If the terms of the policy provide no potential for coverage, as in this case, the insurer acts properly in denying a defense even if that duty is later evaluated under case law that did not exist at the time of the defense tender.

The event in this case that led to Amey's complaint was the purposeful conduct of Waller and Marmac in allegedly mismanaging Marmac property, manipulating the value of Marmac stock, disregarding Amey's rights as a minority shareholder, violating the corporate bylaws, interfering with Amey's prospective economic advantage and inducing Waller to breach his stock-sale contract with Amey. This conduct, according to plaintiffs eventually resulted in financial detriment to Amey and was the reason he suffered \"humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\" Thus, the alleged policy \"occurrence\" under which T.I.E. evaluated coverage was based entirely on economic acts or events that resulted in economic injury and mental and physical damages to Amey. At no point did Amey allege an \"occurrence\" that could have triggered liability and thus a duty to defend, i.e., an event based on a noneconomic act causing either emotional distress or bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs claim that the \"plain meaning of the words [in the insuring clause] would lead the insured to reasonably expect the insurer to defend him against suits seeking damages for bodily injuries caused by an occurrence as defined.\" This argument is misleading, for it ignores the fact that the occurrence or act leading to coverage must be an injury to tangible property, not to one's economic interest. It is well established that CGL <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> policies do not provide coverage for intangible property losses, including economic losses. (<i>Chatton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, 850; <i>Giddings, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App.3d 213</span>.) Both <i>Keating</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> apply the <i>Chatton</i> and <i>Giddings</i> rule, notwithstanding the fact that the insureds in those cases alleged both mental and physical distress caused by the economic occurrence. Because the alleged \"occurrence\" here was the creation of economic loss to Amey, harmful enough to result in his removal from the company, there is no potential for coverage and no corresponding duty to defend under the policy, regardless of the damages allegedly suffered by Amey as a result of that loss.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs next criticize <i>Chatton</i> (and, indirectly, <i>Keating</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i>) for creating an \"economic loss\" exclusion by allegedly confusing the definitions of \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" as they appeared in the CGL policy. This \"economic loss exclusion,\" plaintiffs claim, \"is an unwarranted expansion and attenuation of the holding in <i>Giddings</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App.3d 213</span>,\" which simply held that purely economic losses do not constitute tangible property losses under a CGL policy. (<i>Giddings, supra,</i> 112 Cal. App.3d at pp. 218-219.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs claim that <i>Chatton</i> created an \"economic loss\" exclusion by erroneously eliminating the separate and independent nature of \"bodily injury\" coverage and \"property damage\" coverage in a CGL policy. They argue that <i>Chatton</i> would require covered property damage as a prerequisite to bodily injury and thereby eviscerate the separate and independent coverage for bodily injury resulting from an occurrence, and criticize <i>Chatton's</i> reliance on cases defining \"tangible property loss.\" (See, e.g., <i>Allstate, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. App.3d 825</span>, 830 [economic or contractual losses not tangible property losses in CGL policy]; <i>Kruse</i> v. <i>Bank of America</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">202 Cal. App.3d 38</span>, 67 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">248 Cal. Rptr. 217</span>] [emotional distress damages not recoverable as element of fraud].)</p>\n<p>We agree with the Court of Appeal that plaintiffs' criticism of the <i>Chatton</i> analysis is unwarranted. As the Court of Appeal observed, when the third party complaint alleges emotional and/or physical distress flowing from economic losses \u0097 as was the case in <i>Chatton, Keating,</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> as well as in the present lawsuit \u0097 the occurrence or event that causes damages is an economic loss. There is no separate \"bodily injury\" occurrence within the terms of the policy. Thus, the injured party's claim that he suffered incidental emotional distress flows directly from the economic occurrence and, hence, is not covered by the CGL policy.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeal also noted, the result reached by the courts in <i>Chatton, Keating,</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties when they enter into an insurance contract for CGL <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> coverage. It is simply not within the intent of parties to a CGL contract that the \"bodily injury\" provision would require the insurer to defend a third party lawsuit in which uncovered economic loss is the gravamen of the complaint.</p>\n<p>(9) Plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish this case from <i>Chatton, Keating,</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> on the ground that the definition of \"occurrence\" in the T.I.E. policy is different from the standard definition found in the policies governing the above cases. In the T.I.E. policy, the word \"accident\" is absent from the definition of \"occurrence,\" and there is no modifying language for \"event or series of events\" in the occurrence clause. Plaintiffs claim this indicates that the volitional nature of the occurrence or event leading to coverage is irrelevant, and the T.I.E. policy therefore potentially covers intentional or purposeful acts. Plaintiffs rely on <i>United Pacific Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>McGuire Co.</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">229 Cal. App.3d 1560</span>, 1564 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2177325\"><a href=\"/opinion/2177325/united-pacific-ins-co-v-mcguire-co/\">281 Cal. Rptr. 375</a></span>] (hereafter <i>United Pacific</i>) to support their contention.</p>\n<p>The issue in <i>United Pacific, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2177325\"><a href=\"/opinion/2177325/united-pacific-ins-co-v-mcguire-co/\">supra,</a></span></i> 229 Cal. App.3d at page 1563, was whether a plaintiff's claim of wrongful termination that allegedly resulted in mental distress was an \"event\" within the meaning of a policy endorsement that defined \"occurrence\" to mean \"`an accident, an event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the insured.'\" (Italics omitted.) The <i>United Pacific</i> court held that the expanded policy \"definition of occurrence provides coverage for intentional actions (subject to the statutory limitations of Ins. Code, \u00a7 533) that result in bodily injury but excludes coverage for those elements of <i>damages</i> that were expected or intended by the insured.\" (<i>United Pacific, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2177325\"><a href=\"/opinion/2177325/united-pacific-ins-co-v-mcguire-co/\">supra,</a></span></i> 229 Cal. App.3d at p. 1566, italics added.) Thus, the defendants were covered for the intentional act of terminating the plaintiff, as long as the result of the termination \u0097 i.e., emotional distress \u0097 was not intended by the defendants. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2177325\"><a href=\"/opinion/2177325/united-pacific-ins-co-v-mcguire-co/\">Ibid.</a></span></i>)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs assert that <i>United Pacific</i> supports their argument for a duty to defend in cases involving intentional economic torts that lead to emotional distress. The argument is misplaced. First, in contrast to the present case, the <i>United Pacific</i> court did not question whether coverage for \"bodily injury\" includes incidental emotional distress damages that may flow from a noncovered loss. In addition, as the Court of Appeal below observed, the issue we address does not focus on whether plaintiffs' actions toward Amey were intentional; thus, this difference in the policy language is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Finally, plaintiffs assert that the Court of Appeal disregarded the rule set forth by this court in <i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B.</i> (1993) 4 Cal.4th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> 1076 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal. Rptr.2d 210</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">846 P.2d 792</span>] (hereafter <i>Horace Mann</i>). There, a student sued her teacher primarily for sexual misconduct, but included allegations of negligence in her complaint. The defendant's general liability policy provided for coverage \"`as a result of any claim arising out of an occurrence in the course of the insured's educational employment activities, and caused by any acts or omissions of the insured....'\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 1079-1080.) A majority of this court held that the insurer must provide a defense under the complaint of any claim potentially covered, even though the noncovered claims predominated the action: \"Horace Mann contends that [defendant's] alleged misconduct apart from the molestation could not possibly give rise to liability because the admitted molestation is the `dominant factor' in this case. The argument misconceives the role of the court in determining the duty to defend. We look not to whether noncovered acts predominate in the third party's action, but rather to whether there is <i>any</i> potential for liability under the policy. [Citation.] Since an insurer has a duty to defend the entire third party action if any claim encompassed within it potentially may be covered ... the mere fact that Horace Mann could not indemnify [defendant] for the molestation did not eliminate its duty to defend other, possibly covered claims.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1084, italics in original.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs are correct that the complaint for sexual misconduct in <i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> 4 Cal.4th at pages 1079-1080, alleged potentially covered negligent acts. By contrast, the Amey complaint alleged no potentially covered acts because all allegations were based on the occurrence of business torts, corporate mismanagement and other equally noncovered acts. Moreover, rather than predominate, the noncovered acts in this case comprised the entire complaint. Thus, the facts on which Amey based his theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress were identical business and contract transgressions on which he based the remainder of his complaint. Unlike the complaint in <i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>, therefore, the Amey complaint gave rise to no potential for coverage under T.I.E.'s CGL policy, and hence no duty to defend. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that in addition to the alleged emotional and physical distress, the Amey complaint asserted loss in reputation and humiliation that did not arise from the occurrence of economic loss and should give rise to a duty to defend under <i>Horace Mann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>. This claim is equally unavailing. Plaintiffs assert that Amey's complaint arguably alleged conduct resulting in uncovered \"bodily injury\" as well as potentially covered conduct. For example, plaintiffs claim that although Amey's allegations of physical distress were generally alleged to have been caused by all of the acts set forth in the complaint, his bodily injury allegations were not specific as to \"root causes.\" Plaintiffs note that Amey's allegations were broad and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> varied and alleged that plaintiffs' conduct in changing Amey's job description humiliated him in front of others. In addition, Amey alleged he was upset and distressed by being excluded from the board and shareholder meetings and the decisionmaking process. Amey was also upset that despite his implicit trust in Waller for over 16 years, Marmac's officers entered into a secret stock transaction causing Amey fear, anger, and a sense of betrayal. Indeed, plaintiffs observe, Amey was distressed because he felt he was being forced out of Marmac, a company he felt he owned and which he helped build. Plaintiffs contend that for T.I.E., Farmers, \"and the Court of Appeal to claim that, as a matter of law on undisputed facts, all such allegations necessarily or entirely flowed from economic loss, is, respectfully, incomprehensible.\"</p>\n<p>As T.I.E., Farmers, and the Court of Appeal observe, however, any lost reputation and humiliation Amey may have suffered was, like the emotional and physical distress alleged in the Amey complaint, directly related to the uncovered business torts and economic loss. That plaintiffs' alleged business torts may have caused Amey to feel betrayed, angry or distressed, does not transform those feelings into a separate occurrence under the bodily injury clause of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Waiver and Estoppel</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(10a) The trial court ruled that, as a matter of law, T.I.E.'s denial letter of January 16, 1987, \"waived policy based defenses not specified therein.\" On appeal, T.I.E. challenged the trial court's ruling, but the Court of Appeal declined to reach the issue after concluding there was no potential of coverage under the policy. Plaintiffs now assert that even if <i>Chatton, Keating,</i> and <i>McLaughlin</i> correctly preclude coverage for emotional distress damages arising from an economic occurrence, T.I.E. nonetheless should have been required to provide a defense to the Amey action on the ground that a liability insurer that refuses to defend a suit on a specified ground impliedly waives all other nonspecified grounds it knew or would have discovered by a reasonable investigation.</p>\n<p>In their opening briefs, plaintiffs assert that in addition to waiver of defenses based on T.I.E.'s denial letter, T.I.E.'s \"conduct over the past seven years, particularly the failure to raise the <i>`Keating'</i> issue in its denial letter and subsequent failure to raise the issue during litigation, evidences an objective intent to waive its right to rely on the issue.\" We address the waiver issue notwithstanding the Court of Appeal's refusal to do so, and despite the fact that it was not actually pleaded by plaintiffs at the trial court level, because it was a basis for the trial court's findings and is an important <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> recurring issue that requires our attention. We conclude that an insurer does not impliedly waive coverage defenses it fails to mention when it denies the claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Waiver</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As noted above, T.I.E. denied a defense to the Amey action because it believed the CGL policy provided no potential for coverage for what its claims managers believed was essentially a \"shareholder dispute\" giving rise to uncovered \"intentional acts.\" Plaintiffs assert that because T.I.E.'s denial letter failed to state specifically that the policy did not cover \"economic losses,\" T.I.E. waived its right to rely on <i>Keating</i> and its progeny in denying a duty to defend. In essence, we are asked to consider whether the doctrine of waiver may be invoked to create coverage for losses that the CGL policy by its terms did not cover. We address this issue, notwithstanding the antiwaiver clause in T.I.E.'s policy. That clause states the insurer does not waive rights or terms under the policy in the absence of an endorsement and focuses on the terms and conditions of the policy itself, rather than on the insurer's claims practices. In sum, the clause does not affect the insured's right to assert waiver of defenses in a denial letter.</p>\n<p>(11) Case law is clear that \"`[w]aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.'

Only one state has held that an insurer waives coverage defenses not stated in its initial denial letter. (<i>Armstrong</i> v. <i>Hanover Insurance Company</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">130 Vt. 182</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">289 A.2d 669</span>, 672].)</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing weight of authority, plaintiffs rely on the automatic waiver rule announced in dictum in <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.</i> (N.D.Cal. 1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">565 F. Supp. 434</span>. In attempting to predict what this court would do when faced with the waiver issue, the <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Connecticut General Life</i> court held that \"an insurance company which relies on specified grounds for denying a claim thereby waives the right to rely in a subsequent litigation on any other grounds which a reasonable investigation would have uncovered.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 451.) The federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> district court relied on this court's decisions recognizing the insurer's duty to conduct a reasonable investigation in order to comply with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (<i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>Egan</i> v. <i>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co.</i> (1979) <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal.3d 809</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. Rptr. 691</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">620 P.2d 141</span>].)</p>\n<p>T.I.E. and Farmers assert <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">565 F. Supp. 434</span>, has been superseded by the Ninth Circuit decision in <i>Intel Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co.</i> (9th Cir.1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">952 F.2d 1551</span>, 1559 (hereafter <i>Intel</i>), which concluded that \"in <i>McLaughlin</i> it was necessary to find waiver to protect insureds who had been misled by the insurer's statements as to the denial of coverage.\" (<i>Intel, supra,</i> 952 F.2d at p. 1560.) Nonetheless, the <i>Intel</i> court rejected application of an automatic waiver rule and determined that under California law, an insurer waives defenses to coverage not asserted in its denial only if the insured can show misconduct by the insurer or detrimental reliance by the insured. (<i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>Aceves</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> (S.D.Cal. 1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458677\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458677/aceves-v-allstate-ins-co/\">827 F. Supp. 1473</a></span>, 1476-1477 [under <i>Intel</i> insurer may raise all available defenses to coverage at any time unless the insured proves detrimental reliance].) Plaintiffs urge us to reject the reasoning of <i>Intel</i> on the grounds that it (1) blurs the waiver-estoppel doctrines and erroneously applies the estoppel doctrine of detrimental reliance to issues involving waiver, (2) would preclude prompt, summary adjudication of legal issues pertinent to the meaning of the words of denial, and (3) would lead to a proliferation of bad faith lawsuits. Plaintiffs assert that the <i>McLaughlin</i> automatic waiver rule \"provides an incentive for carriers to promptly disclose bases for denial [and] reduces or eliminates litigation by means of a rule easy to understand and apply.\"</p>\n<p>We agree with <i>Intel, supra,</i> 952 F.2d at page 1559, and decline to follow the <i>McLaughlin</i> rule of automatic waiver. A holding that an insurer waives defenses not asserted in its initial denial of a duty to defend would be inconsistent with established waiver principles by erroneously implying an intent to relinquish contract rights where no such intent existed. Such a conclusion would contradict the holdings of the majority of California and sister-state cases addressing the waiver issue. (See, e.g., <i>Velasquez</i> v. <i>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">1 Cal. App.4th 712</span>, 722.)</p>\n<p>(12), (10c) As the <i>Intel</i> court recognized, in the insurance context the terms \"waiver\" and \"estoppel\" are sometimes used interchangeably, even though estoppel requires proof of the insured's detrimental reliance. (<i>Intel, supra,</i> 952 F.2d at p. 1560.) Nonetheless, as the <i>Intel</i> court observed, \"[w]aiver is an affirmative defense, for which the insured bears the burden of proof,\" and \"California courts will find waiver when a party intentionally relinquishes a right or when that party's acts are so inconsistent with an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1559.) The present facts do not show that T.I.E.'s denial letter indicated an intention on the part of the insurer to relinquish additional reasons for denial of a duty to defend. Nor have plaintiffs shown that T.I.E.'s actions following its defense denial were inconsistent with its intent to enforce the terms of the policy. Accordingly, plaintiffs have not shown that T.I.E.'s denial of a defense induced a reasonable belief in plaintiffs that T.I.E. intended to waive additional policy defenses. To the extent <i>Alta Cal. Regional Center</i> v. <i>Fremont Indemnity Co., supra,</i> 25 Cal. App.4th at page 466, relies on <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Connecticut General Life, Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">565 F. Supp. 434</span>, and its rule of automatic waiver, it is disapproved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Estoppel</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(13) Plaintiffs also assert that notwithstanding our resolution of the <i>McLaughlin</i> waiver issue, T.I.E. should be estopped from denying a duty to defend on the basis of <i>Keating</i> and its progeny because the insurer anticipated the <i>Keating</i> decision at the time it denied a defense to the Amey action, but failed to state \"economic loss\" as a reason for denying a defense in its denial letter. This allegedly \"wrongful conduct\" by the insurer, plaintiffs claim, precluded plaintiffs from developing \"facts [showing that] Amey's alleged bodily injury arose from causes other than economic loss.\"</p>\n<p>As T.I.E. observes, however, proof of estoppel requires a showing of detrimental reliance by the injured party. (See <i>State Farm Fire Casualty co.</i> v. <i>Jioras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2263721\"><a href=\"/opinion/2263721/state-farm-fire-casualty-co-v-jioras/\">supra,</a></span></i> 24 Cal. App.4th at pp. 1627-1628; 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Equity, \u00a7 177, p. 859.) Plaintiffs do not show how they relied to their detriment on T.I.E.'s grounds for denial. In the absence of any such proof, plaintiffs cannot show detrimental reliance on the grounds for denial of a defense.</p>\n<p>In the present case, T.I.E.'s letter denying a defense and coverage on the ground that the Amey complaint represented nothing more than a \"shareholder dispute\" based on \"intentional acts\" unequivocally informed plaintiffs that the insurer was denying coverage under the terms of the policy. A \"shareholder dispute\" is essentially a \"business dispute\" and, in the context of the Amey allegations as set forth in the second amended complaint, would never give rise to the potential for coverage under T.I.E.'s CGL policy. T.I.E.'s denial letter thus adequately explained the factual basis for the insurer's rejection of a defense. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 2695.2, subd. (z) [insurer's denial of claim shall be in writing and shall provide factual basis of denial that is within the insurer's knowledge at the time claim is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> denied].) Moreover, the fact that coverage was defined in terms of an \"event\" as opposed to an \"accident\" could in no way lead to potential coverage for business torts, whether these torts are characterized by the insured as \"intentional\" or \"negligent\" acts. As noted above, T.I.E.'s CGL policy provided coverage for tangible or physical property losses and bodily injury caused by an \"occurrence.\" Because the \"occurrence\" here was the ongoing business dispute between Amey and plaintiffs, the allegations in the Amey complaint fell outside the scope of T.I.E.'s CGL coverage. (<i>Giddings, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App.3d 213</span>.) Accordingly, plaintiffs' alleged detrimental reliance on T.I.E.'s initial denial letter could not give rise to a claim for estoppel because plaintiffs never reasonably believed, nor could they reasonably believe, that the T.I.E. policy provided a potential for coverage for Amey's lawsuit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Bad Faith</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(14a) We next consider whether plaintiffs may state causes of action for either breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or violation of Insurance Code section 790.03 for unfair business practices, when the policy does not provide such coverage by its terms. We do so after recognizing that the present case was not final when we held that section 790.03 confers no private right of action for damages. (<i>Moradi-Shalal</i> v. <i>Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">46 Cal.3d 287</span>, 305 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">250 Cal. Rptr. 116</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">758 P.2d 58</span>] [decision will be applied prospectively]; see also <i>Zepher Park</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">213 Cal. App.3d 833</span>, 837-838 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">262 Cal. Rptr. 106</span>] [<i>Moradi-Shalal</i> applies to first party actions].)</p>\n<p>In its original decision, the Court of Appeal noted at the beginning of its discussion that because a contractual obligation is the underpinning of a bad faith claim, such a claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due under the contract. (See, e.g., <i>Love</i> v. <i>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.3d 1136</span>, 1153.) After finding that T.I.E. owed no duty to defend the Amey action, the Court of Appeal concluded that because there was no contractual liability on the part of T.I.E., plaintiffs could not assert a valid bad faith claim. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1151.) Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded, Farmers also could not be found liable for bad faith conduct. Although the court ignored the issue of T.I.E.'s (and Farmers's) liability under Insurance Code section 790.03, on petition for rehearing the opinion was modified to add a citation to <i>Brodkin</i> v. <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">217 Cal. App.3d 210</span>, 218 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">265 Cal. Rptr. 710</span>], which held that \"there can be no cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith <i>or of any statutory duty</i>\" because the insurer defendant had properly denied the claim under the policy. (Italics added.) We agree with the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> It is clear that if there is no <i>potential</i> for coverage and, hence, no duty to defend under the terms of the policy, there can be no action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the covenant is based on the contractual relationship between the insured and the insurer. (<i>Love</i> v. <i>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.3d 1136</span>, 1151-1153.) As the <i>Love</i> court observed, its \"conclusion that a bad faith claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due is in accord with the policy in which the duty of good faith is [firmly] rooted.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1153.) The legal principle is based on general contract law and the long-standing rule \"`that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.'\" (<i>Gruenberg</i> v. <i>Aetna Ins. Co.</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\">9 Cal.3d 566</span>, 573 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">108 Cal. Rptr. 480</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">510 P.2d 1032</span>], citing <i>Communale</i> v. <i>General Ins. Co.</i> (1958) <span class=\"citation no-link\">50 Cal.2d 654</span>, 658 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">328 P.2d 198</span>]; see also <i>Egan</i> v. <i>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., supra,</i> 24 Cal.3d at p. 818.) In sum, the covenant is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party's rights to the benefits of the agreement. (<i>Love, supra,</i> 221 Cal. App.3d at p. 1153.) Thus, as the <i>Love</i> court noted, when benefits are due an insured, \"delayed payment based on inadequate or tardy investigations, oppressive conduct by claims adjusters seeking to reduce the amounts legitimately payable and numerous other tactics may breach the implied covenant because\" they frustrate the insured's right to receive the benefits of the contract in \"prompt compensation for losses.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>) Absent that contractual right, however, the implied covenant has nothing upon which to act as a supplement, and \"should not be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>(15) When evaluating an insurer's alleged violation of Insurance Code section 790.03, we are guided by the principles of first party coverage, and the fact that the insurer owes its insured an independent duty to process all claims submitted to it in a reasonable manner, and not to delay, to the insured's prejudice, the ultimate decision to defend or indemnify. For example, where an insurer undertakes a defense under a reservation of rights, and then fails to pursue the defense in a reasonable manner, the insurer may be subject to penalties under section 790.03. (See, e.g., <i>Travelers Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Lesher</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">187 Cal. App.3d 169</span>, 190 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">231 Cal. Rptr. 791</span>] [insurer must process all claims submitted to it competently even when no coverage will be provided].) Thus, our holding does not foreclose the insurance commissioner from imposing administrative sanctions against an insurance company responsible for committing unfair practices that are independent of the insurance contract and proscribed by section 790.03. (<i>Moradi-Shalal</i> v. <i>Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies, supra,</i> 46 Cal.3d at p. 304.)</p>\n<p>(14b) In the present case, however, we cannot say that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding neither T.I.E. nor Farmers violated Insurance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> Code section 790.03. There is no indication that either defendant unnecessarily delayed performing its investigative duties under the policy or misled plaintiffs into believing it would provide either a defense or coverage to the Amey complaint, and any finding to the contrary would misconstrue the record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>If an insurance policy provides no potential basis for coverage, the insurer is under no duty to defend an action against the insured. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) We conclude T.I.E.'s CGL policy provided no potential for coverage in a suit based on business and economic torts. Because T.I.E. was under no obligation to defend or indemnify the Amey action, it did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In addition, T.I.E.'s denial of a defense did not independently violate Insurance Code section 790.03. The same holding applies to Farmers, as T.I.E.'s adjuster. We therefore conclude the Court of Appeal's judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>Mosk, J., Arabian, J., Baxter, J., George, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>KENNARD, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</p>\n<p>Insurance policies are, first and last, contracts. This court has repeatedly emphasized that by and large an insurance policy is interpreted no differently than any other contract, and that when the parties express their intent in unambiguous language in the policy, that intent governs. Although courts have evolved special rules for interpreting ambiguities in insurance policies, what these rules have in common is that they protect the insured. No special rules have developed that deny an insured coverage that an insurer has promised in unambiguous policy language.</p>\n<p>In this case, the majority makes a sharp departure from the mainstream of insurance coverage law. Rather than hewing to the language of the insurance policy at issue in this case, the majority concludes that coverage within the ordinary and unambiguous meaning of the policy language does not exist.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the majority holds that the liability insurance policy issued by defendant insurers excludes coverage for bodily injuries related to economic (i.e., intangible property) losses. The majority errs in doing so, for its conclusion finds no support in the language of the policy or in any other evidence of the mutual intent of defendant insurers and plaintiff insureds. The plain language of the policy covers liability for all bodily injuries caused by an \"occurrence.\" The policy defines \"occurrence\" as any \"event, or series of events ... proximately caused by an act or omission of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> insured ... which results ... in bodily injury ... neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Nothing in the ordinary meaning of this language, and nothing in the rest of the policy, excludes coverage for bodily injuries resulting from events that either themselves are economic losses or cause economic losses in addition to bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Because the majority's approach has no support in our law or in the language of the contract at issue here, I disagree with the majority's reasoning. As I shall explain, however, I would nonetheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal because there is an independent reason why defendant insurers properly denied coverage here: Plaintiff insureds sought coverage under the bodily injury coverage of the insurance policy for a lawsuit alleging they had intentionally caused someone to suffer emotional and physical distress; the insurance policy excludes coverage for bodily injuries expected or intended by the insureds, such as the intentional injuries alleged against the insureds; thus, there was no coverage under the policy for the lawsuit against plaintiff insureds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Waller owned 60 percent of Marmac, Inc. (Marmac) and was its president; Amey owned 40 percent and was its vice-president. Waller sold his stock to Marmac employees Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen (referred to hereafter collectively with Waller and Marmac as the insureds), who thereafter demoted and ultimately terminated Amey.</p>\n<p>Amey sued the insureds. Amey alleged 12 causes of action in his amended complaint, including, as relevant here, one for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p>In his cause of action for emotional distress, Amey alleged that he suffered \"humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress\" from the \"conduct\" of the individual insureds alleged in the other causes of action (for example, Waller's sale of his stock to Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen without notice to Amey and allegedly in breach of a contract to sell the stock to Amey; the alleged interference by Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen with Amey's contract with Waller for the sale of Waller's stock; Amey's demotion and subsequent termination in breach of his employment contract with Marmac; Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen's bad faith abuse of their positions as controlling shareholders and directors to engage in self-dealing and to deny Amey a voice in corporate affairs). Amey alleged that the individual insureds' conduct had been \"intentional and malicious and ... done for the purpose of causing Amey ... emotional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> and physical distress.\" At his deposition, Amey testified he had suffered headaches, back pains, and rashes as a result of the individual insureds' conduct.</p>\n<p>The insureds were insured under a policy issued by Truck Insurance Exchange through Farmers Insurance Exchange (collectively Truck). The insureds tendered their defense to Truck, which rejected it on the ground that Amey's causes of action were not covered under the policy. The insureds sued Truck for bad faith denial of its duty to defend, contending that Amey's cause of action for emotional distress was covered under the Truck policy. The insureds also alleged that Truck had breached its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h), which prohibits various acts and practices by insurers in processing and settling the claims of their insureds. In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court held that Amey's cause of action for emotional distress was covered under the policy and, accordingly, Truck had a duty to defend; a jury then determined that Truck had also breached its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the Truck policy did not cover bodily injury related to economic loss, and holding that there could be no cause of action under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h) because there was no coverage under the Truck policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Whether Truck had a duty to defend turns on whether the relevant facts or pleadings give rise to any potential for coverage under the policy. (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.2d 263</span>, 277 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal. Rptr. 104</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">419 P.2d 168</span>].) The insureds contend that there was the potential for coverage under the policy of Amey's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. I conclude that there was no potential for coverage because Amey's cause of action fell within the policy's exclusion of injuries expected or intended by the insured.</p>\n<p>In <i>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc.</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611826\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611826/la-jolla-beach-tennis-club-v-industrial-indemnity/\">9 Cal.4th 27</a></span>, 37 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">36 Cal. Rptr.2d 100</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">884 P.2d 1048</span>], this court recently summarized the principles governing the interpretation of insurance contracts: \"`While insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.' (<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal.4th 1254</span>, 1264 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal.

(Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.)' (<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 2 Cal.4th at p. 1264.) `Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.' (<i>AIU Ins.

(<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 2 Cal.4th at p. 1264.)\"</p>\n<p>Application of these principles yields a straightforward resolution of this case. No party has put forward extrinsic evidence bearing on the interpretation of the policy. Therefore, it is solely the language of the policy that determines whether coverage exists.</p>\n<p>The coverage clause of the policy obligates the insurer to \"pay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of [\u00b6] (C) <i>bodily injury</i> to any person ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... <i>caused by an occurrence.</i>\" (Italics added.) The question of coverage therefore turns on whether there was \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence.\"</p>\n<p>Did Amey allege a \"bodily injury\" within the meaning of the policy? The policy defines \"bodily injury\" as \"bodily injury, sickness, or disease.\" Amey alleged in his complaint that he had suffered both emotional and physical distress as a result of the insureds' conduct. At his deposition, Amey testified that the insureds' conduct had caused him to suffer headaches, back pains, and rashes.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Most of the courts that have addressed the issue have held that any physical manifestations accompanying emotional distress are \"bodily injuries\" as that term is used in insurance policies.

On its face, the policy's definitional language, \"bodily injury, sickness, or disease,\" broadly covers any somatic condition, and does not exclude those that are caused or accompanied by mental distress. Although I therefore assume for purposes of this case that at least the physical symptoms Amey alleged he suffered were \"bodily injuries\" within the meaning of the policy, it is not necessary to decide the issue because I conclude, for the reasons discussed below, that there was no \"occurrence\" within the policy's definition of that term.</p>\n<p>Were Amey's \"bodily injuries\" caused by an \"occurrence\"? The policy defines \"occurrence\" to mean \"an <i>event,</i> or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, <i>proximately caused by</i> an act or omission of <i>the insured</i> regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by such act or omission <i>which results,</i> during the policy period, in <i>bodily injury</i> or property damage, <i>neither expected nor intended</i> from the standpoint of the insured.\" (Italics added.) Stated otherwise, the elements of an \"occurrence\" can be broken down into (1) an event or series of events (2) proximately caused by the insured (3) resulting in bodily injury or property damage, (4) with the injury or damage being neither expected nor intended.</p>\n<p>The majority and I agree on the elements of the \"occurrence\" definition. (See maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 20 [\"to demonstrate a potential for coverage under [Truck's] policy, an insured must show the claim he must defend is an alleged act or omission that caused bodily injury or tangible property damage (as defined by the policy) to the third party, and that the alleged injury was neither expected nor intended by the insured\"].) The majority, however, never applies these elements to the facts of this case to determine whether there was a potential for coverage of Amey's claims against the insureds. Accordingly, I do so here.</p>\n<p>The first element of the definition of \"occurrence\" requires an \"event, or series of events.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The conduct of plaintiffs that Amey alleged caused his injury (e.g., his demotion, the sale of stock from Waller to the other four plaintiffs) certainly was a series of events in the ordinary meaning of the term.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> The second element of \"occurrence\" requires that the insured proximately cause the event or events. There is no dispute that the events alleged by Amey to have caused his injury were ones that he alleged the individual insureds had proximately caused.</p>\n<p>The third element of \"occurrence\" requires, as relevant here, that the events result in bodily injury. As I have already explained, to the extent Amey suffered physical manifestations of his emotional distress, I assume the events resulted in bodily injury.</p>\n<p>The fourth element of the definition of \"occurrence\" requires that the bodily injury be \"neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" It is on this point that the insureds' claim for coverage fails. The intentional infliction of emotional distress that Amey alleged is not an occurrence within the policy's definition because the tort requires that the insured either intend or expect that the emotional distress (and any accompanying physical manifestations) occur. \"The tort calls for intentional, or at least reckless conduct \u0097 conduct intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.\" (<i>Davidson</i> v. <i>City of Westminster</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation no-link\">32 Cal.3d 197</span>, 210 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">185 Cal. Rptr. 252</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">649 P.2d 894</span>].) To state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege \"that the conduct of ... the defendants was directed primarily at them, was calculated to cause them severe emotional distress, or was done with knowledge of their presence and of a substantial certainty that they would suffer severe emotional injury.\" (<i>Christensen</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1385913\"><a href=\"/opinion/1385913/christensen-v-superior-court/\">54 Cal.3d 868</a></span>, 906 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal. Rptr.2d 79</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">820 P.2d 181</span>].)</p>\n<p>Any injury caused by the insured that is calculated (i.e., intended), or which the insured knew was substantially certain to result from the insured's conduct, however, is an injury that the insured \"expected or intended.\" (<i>Shell Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra,</i> 12 Cal. App.4th at pp. 745-748 [insured \"expected or intended\" a result if the insured intended the result or believed the result was substantially certain or highly likely to occur].) Because the intentional infliction of emotional distress is an injury that is either \"calculated\" by the insured or that the insured knew was \"substantial[ly] certain[]\" to result (<i>Christensen</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 54 Cal.3d at p. 906), policy language that, as here, excludes from coverage acts that the insured \"expected or intended\" thereby excludes coverage of any cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> In this case, Amey specifically alleged that the insureds' acts were intended to cause him both emotional and physical injury. Both Amey's original complaint and his amended complaint alleged that the conduct of the insureds \"was intentional and malicious and was done for the purpose of causing Amey to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\" The definition of \"occurrence\" in the Truck policy excludes events resulting in injuries that the insured expects or intends. (See <i>Shell Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra,</i> 12 Cal. App.4th at pp. 745-748.) Therefore, Amey's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress cannot be a covered occurrence because it alleged that the insureds intended the emotional and physical injuries that they caused him.<sup>[3]</sup> (Accord, <i>Smith</i> v. <i>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co.</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722805/smith-v-state-farm-fire-cas-co/\">127 Wis.2d 298</a></span>, 302-304 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722805/smith-v-state-farm-fire-cas-co/\">380 N.W.2d 372</a></span>, 374-375].) Because there was no potential for coverage under the policy's definition of \"occurrence\" for the emotional and physical distress the insureds allegedly intentionally caused to Amey, Truck properly denied the insureds' tender of their defense.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The majority, however, ignores the controlling language of the policy that I have just discussed. Instead, the majority manufactures an exclusion of bodily injuries \"related to\" economic losses that has no basis in the policy language or in any other indicia of the parties' intent, and on that ground concludes there was no potential for coverage of Amey's lawsuit against the insureds. The majority asserts that because the events underlying Amey's lawsuit caused uncovered \"economic\" (i.e., intangible property) losses to Amey, there can be no coverage for any bodily injuries to Amey that were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> caused by, or even related to, the same events. Under the majority's view, there is no coverage for bodily injuries that are in any way related to economic losses.</p>\n<p>On what basis does the majority reach this conclusion? Instead of closely analyzing the policy language to determine whether coverage exists, the majority engages in a lengthy recitation of three cases on which the Court of Appeal relied, and then in a conclusory paragraph asserts that \"CGL policies do not provide coverage for economic losses that cause emotional distress.... These policies were never intended to cover emotional distress damages that flow from an uncovered `occurrence,' ...\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 23.) Accordingly, the majority concludes that there was no potential for coverage because \"[a]ll allegations in the Amey complaint were related to Amey's asserted <i>economic loss</i> as a Marmac shareholder.\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722805/smith-v-state-farm-fire-cas-co/\">Ibid.</a></span></i>)</p>\n<p>The majority's conclusion is wrong. The majority's exclusion of all bodily injuries \"related to\" an economic loss is an unsupportable judicial rewriting of the insurance contract at issue here. The majority does not and cannot justify its sweeping statements by anything found in the language of the policy. Contrary to the majority's conclusion, nothing in the language of the insureds' policy with Truck excludes coverage for bodily injuries that are \"related to\" (maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 23) economic losses. The Truck policy's definition of \"bodily injury\" does not exclude injuries that are caused by or related to economic losses. It covers all \"bodily injury, sickness or disease,\" regardless of the cause.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Truck policy's definition of \"occurrence\" broadly encompasses any \"event, or series of events,\" that \"results in ... bodily injury,\" whether or not one of the events in the chain of causation also causes a concurrent economic loss or is itself an economic loss.<sup>[5]</sup> The policy's definition of \"occurrence\" nowhere excludes from that term events that either are economic losses or are \"related to\" economic losses. The ordinary meaning of \"event\" is \"something that happens.\" (Webster's New Collegiate Dict. (9th ed. 1988) p. 430.) An economic loss is \"something that happens.\"</p>\n<p>Thus, there is nothing in the policy language that limits \"occurrence,\" as the majority does, to \"an event based on a noneconomic act\" (maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 26). Rather, as I set forth earlier, the policy defines an \"occurrence\" to include events that result in bodily injury. An occurrence does not become a nonoccurrence simply because the event causes both bodily injury and economic loss.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> The majority's erroneous conclusion arises from its mistaken view that the bodily injury and property damage coverages of the Truck policy are somehow interdependent, and that therefore \"the occurrence or act leading to coverage must be an injury to tangible property, not to one's economic interest.\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 26.) The majority's conclusion is contrary to the express policy language at issue in this case.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The coverage clause of the policy obligates the insurer to \"pay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of [\u00b6] (C) <i>bodily injury</i> to any person, and [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] (E) damage to property ... [\u00b6] to which this insurance applies, <i>caused by an occurrence.</i>\" (Italics added.) The bodily injury coverage (which the policy refers to as \"Coverage C\") is independent of the property damage coverage (which the policy refers to as \"Coverage E\"). Coverage E and coverage C, for example, are subject to different exclusions, can be separately purchased, and can be subject to different liability limits. The coverage clause does not require that for a bodily injury to be covered under coverage C it must be caused by property damage covered under coverage E. Likewise, under the policy's definition of occurrence, it is irrelevant whether the event resulting in bodily injury under coverage C takes the form of property loss that is not covered under coverage E; all that is necessary is that the event, whatever its nature, \"result[] in ... bodily injury.\"</p>\n<p>The majority is therefore wrong in its assertion that coverage for bodily injury under coverage C is limited to events that also cause property damage that is covered under coverage E. (\"[T]he occurrence or act leading to coverage [for bodily injury under coverage C] must be an injury to tangible property [i.e., property damage covered under coverage E], not to one's economic interest.\" Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 26.) The Truck policy independently covers either property damage <i>or</i> bodily injury resulting from an event or series of events proximately caused by an insured, regardless of the nature of the intermediate events in the chain of causation.</p>\n<p>The majority maintains nonetheless that it was the \"intent of the parties\" to exclude from coverage bodily injuries related to economic losses. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 28.) But the majority offers no evidence that the parties here mutually held this supposed intent. What the majority calls the \"intent\" of the parties is actually its own opinion of how insurance policies should be drafted. It is not this court's function, however, to draft or redraft insurance policies. The true intent of the parties in this case is the meaning to be found in the language of the policy \u0097 nothing more, nothing less. As the analysis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> above reveals, the policy language reflects no intent to exclude all bodily injuries related to economic losses.</p>\n<p>Nor are the three cases relied on by the majority and by the Court of Appeal persuasive. Like the majority, those decisions failed to ground their conclusions in the contractual language before them. In the first of those cases, <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, 857 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">13 Cal. Rptr.2d 318</span>], defrauded investors sought to recover from the insurer of a corporation's directors and officers for the emotional distress (without any physical symptoms) caused by \"the loss of their investment.\" The Court of Appeal in <i>Chatton</i> concluded that emotional distress without accompanying physical manifestations is not \"bodily injury\" for purposes of a policy containing the same \"bodily injury\" definition that is at issue here. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 853-857.) Although this holding was dispositive of the case, since the shareholders had not claimed any physical symptoms, the court went on to conclude that the wrongful acts also were not accidental and therefore were not \"occurrences\" under a policy definition that, unlike the policy in this case, required that occurrences be accidents, not merely events. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 860-862.) Finally, <i>Chatton</i> held that when a policy provides coverage for bodily injury <i>or</i> tangible property damage, there is no coverage for bodily injuries caused by intangible property loss. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 857-860.)</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal in <i>Chatton</i> based its conclusion that the policy before it excluded coverage for bodily injuries caused by intangible property loss on its assertion that \"the `bodily injury' clause of the CGL policy ... incorporated coverage for loss or destruction of tangible property as well.\" (<i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra,</i> 10 Cal. App.4th at p. 860.) The court, however, did not explain how the bodily injury coverage \"incorporated\" the property damage coverage, nor could it have done so, for in <i>Chatton,</i> as here, the two forms of coverage were independent. Like the majority, the <i>Chatton</i> court erroneously collapsed the two forms of coverage together. <i>Chatton</i> failed to recognize that any bodily injuries, whatever their cause, were independently covered under the bodily injury coverage, and it viewed bodily injury caused by economic loss only as a form of consequential damages accompanying an uncovered intangible property loss. The two cases that follow <i>Chatton,</i> and on which the majority also relies, <i>Keating</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins.</i> (9th Cir.1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">995 F.2d 154</span>, 156-157, and <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Cal. App.4th 1132</span>, 1150-1151 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. Rptr.2d 559</span>], adopt <i>Chatton</i>'s faulty analysis without adding anything to it.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to being contrary to the language of the Truck policy, the majority's adoption of <i>Chatton</i>'s approach is at odds with this court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> decision in <i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>, 1084 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal. Rptr.2d 210</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">846 P.2d 792</span>]. <i>Horace Mann</i> rejected the notion that the existence of a duty to defend turns on whether there is coverage for the \"dominant factor\" of the lawsuit. Rather, in determining the duty to defend, \"[w]e look not to whether noncovered acts predominate in the third party's action, but rather to whether there is <i>any</i> potential for liability under the policy.\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> original italics.) <i>Horace Mann</i> thus precludes the majority's approach of excluding covered losses simply because they are \"related to\" (maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 30) uncovered losses that are the dominant factor in the lawsuit against the insured.</p>\n<p>Even if the decisions in <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, <i>Keating</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608200\"><a href=\"/opinion/608200/charles-h-keating-jr-andrew-ligget-charles-a-keating-iii-robert/\">995 F.2d 154</a></span>, and <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Cal. App.4th 1132</span>, were correct, they would be inapplicable on the facts of this case. The injured parties in the three cases just cited were defrauded investors who were emotionally distressed because they had lost money, not because of the content of the fraudulent statements or the other conduct by the insureds that caused them to lose money. Unlike the injured investors in those cases, however, Amey did not allege that his emotional and physical distress arose from the financial loss caused by the insureds. Rather, he alleged that his emotional and physical distress arose from his demotion and termination, his loss of influence and control over Marmac, and other \"conduct\" by the insureds \u0097 conduct that <i>in addition</i> caused him financial loss. Intangible economic loss was not the cause, only an accompaniment, of Amey's emotional and physical distress. Amey's distress and his economic loss were concurrent effects of the insureds' conduct, not successive effects as was the case in <i>Chatton.</i> Thus, here Amey's emotional and physical distress was independent of his economic loss in a way that was not true in <i>Chatton.</i><sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor can the majority's holding be justified by its assertion that the exclusion of bodily injury related to economic loss conforms to the \"reasonable expectations\" of the insureds. The reasonable expectations doctrine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> comes into play only when the language of an insurance policy relevant to a particular question of coverage is ambiguous. (<i>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc.</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra,</i> 9 Cal.4th at p. 37; <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal.4th 1254</span>, 1264-1265 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. Rptr.2d 538</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">833 P.2d 545</span>]; <i>Reserve Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Pisciotta</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation no-link\">30 Cal.3d 800</span>, 807-808 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">180 Cal. Rptr. 628</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">640 P.2d 764</span>].) As there is no ambiguous policy language to construe here, there is no basis for applying the reasonable expectations doctrine in this case. Even if there were some basis for applying it here, the doctrine requires a court to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured by extending coverage to the insured. (<i>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc.</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra,</i> 9 Cal.4th at p. 37; <i>AIU Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 Cal.3d 807</span>, 822 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">274 Cal. Rptr. 820</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">799 P.2d 1253</span>].) This court has never deployed the reasonable expectations doctrine as the majority does here to <i>deny</i> an insured coverage that is within the ordinary and unambiguous meaning of the policy language, and it is a misuse of the doctrine to do so.</p>\n<p>The majority creates a blanket rule that no coverage exists under the bodily injury liability provisions of an insurance policy if the bodily injury is related to property damage not covered by the policy. That rule will restrict the bodily injury coverage provided by any policy that, like the Truck policy here, on its face covers bodily injury independent of whether or not any related property damage is covered by the policy. For example, assume a policy that provides coverage for bodily injuries, but not property damage, caused by the insured. The majority's reasoning would deny an insured coverage for any bodily injury caused by property damage (e.g., if the insured's car strikes and damages a tree that falls and injures someone) solely because there is no coverage for the property damage that is the immediate cause of the bodily injury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The ordinary meaning of the pertinent Truck policy language covers bodily injuries without regard for the nature of the event causing the bodily injury. The policy therefore covers bodily injuries that are caused by economic losses or, as here, are caused by an event that also causes an economic loss. Had Truck wanted to exclude coverage for bodily injuries related to economic loss, it could, as the drafter of the policy at issue in this case, have so provided. It is not the proper role of this court to manufacture coverage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> exclusions that are contrary to the express language of the policy, as the majority does here.</p>\n<p>As I have previously explained, however, Amey's complaint did not allege an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the Truck policy for a far different reason. The policy defines an \"occurrence\" as an event resulting in bodily injury <i>neither expected nor intended</i> by the insured. Amey alleged that the emotional and physical distress that he suffered was intended by the insureds. Because he alleged that the insureds intended to cause him those injuries, those injuries were not caused by an \"occurrence\" within the policy's definition of that term. It is on that ground that I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p>Respondents' petition for a rehearing was denied October 26, 1995, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because the Court of Appeal believed that CGL policies were never intended to cover conduct that causes economic losses, it did not address (except for brief reference in a footnote) either the \"named insured\" or \"employee liability\" exclusions that may have provided additional grounds for denying a duty to defend the Amey action. We find it unnecessary to address alternative grounds for denying a duty to defend in this case.</p>\n<p>[1]  The insureds renewed their tender of defense on the basis of Amey's deposition testimony; Truck never responded.</p>\n<p>[2]  The requirement of an \"event\" that causes injury is a departure in Truck's policy from the language of the current standard commercial general liability (CGL) policy drafted by the Insurance Services Office (an insurance industry trade group). The standard CGL policy requires that an \"accident,\" not an \"event,\" cause the injury. (Insurance Services Office, Commercial General Liability Coverage Form (eff. Jan. 1, 1986), reprinted in 3 Cal. Insurance Law and Practice (1995) Business General Liability Policies, appen. C.) The Truck policy represents a broadening of coverage in that the cause of injury no longer need be sudden and fortuitous, as it must be under an \"accident\" occurrence clause. (Compare <i>United Pacific Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>McGuire Co.</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">229 Cal. App.3d 1560</span>, 1565 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">281 Cal. Rptr. 375</span>] [\"the word `event' is not limited to fortuitous happenings\"] with <i>Shell Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal. App.4th 715</span>, 751 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">15 Cal. Rptr.2d 815</span>] [discussing \"accident\" occurrence clause's requirements of suddenness and fortuity].)\n</p>\n<p>In this respect, the majority is mistaken in describing the Truck policy as a \"standard\" CGL policy. (See maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 19.)</p>\n<p>[3]  The insureds do not contend that, although Amey's complaint was limited to the intentional infliction of emotional distress, he might have ultimately recovered damages for emotional and physical distress on a theory that those injuries were negligently inflicted and that therefore there was a potential for coverage. (See <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co., supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)</p>\n<p>[4]  Truck denied coverage to the insureds on the ground that \"Intentional Acts are not covered....\" Although inartfully phrased (because it focuses on intentional acts rather than intentional damage or injury), it seems clear that the purpose of Truck's letter was to invoke the \"neither expected nor intended\" language of the \"occurrence\" definition. Because I conclude that there was no potential for coverage for the same reason, I find it unnecessary to address the waiver and estoppel arguments addressed in section C of the majority opinion. Likewise, I do not have occasion to address the retroactivity and legal uncertainty issues considered by the majority. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at pp. 24-26.) Nor is it necessary for me to address the other alternative grounds for denying coverage put forward by Truck. (See maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 20, fn. 1.)\n</p>\n<p>I concur in the majority's decision that in the absence of any potential for coverage the insureds do not have a cause of action against Truck for its alleged violation of its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h) with respect to its processing and resolution of the insureds' claim for coverage.</p>\n<p>[5]  In this part, I put aside for the moment the \"neither expected nor intended\" portion of the Truck policy's definition of \"occurrence\" that I discussed previously in part II, as the majority does not base its exclusion of bodily injuries related to economic losses on that language.</p>\n<p>[6]  The majority's conclusion is also contrary to its acknowledgment elsewhere that \"the CGL policy provides coverage for `occurrences' that cause bodily injury <i>or</i> tangible property losses.\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> at p. 23, italics added.)</p>\n<p>[7]  Nor does <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Interbank Financial Services</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. App.3d 825</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">264 Cal. Rptr. 25</span>] support the majority's holding. <i>Allstate</i> involved a policy with language quite different from either the Truck policy at issue in this case or the standard CGL policy. In <i>Allstate</i> the insureds were sued for economic losses (but not emotional or physical injuries) allegedly caused by erroneous and fraudulent investment advice they had provided. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 827-828.) The policy in <i>Allstate</i> excluded coverage for damages \"`arising out of the rendering of or the failure to render ... professional services, or consulting business ... services.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 829.) The court held that under this exclusion there was no coverage under the policy for the lawsuit against the insureds; \"the clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 831.) That the quite different policy language in <i>Allstate</i> did not cover economic losses caused by the investment advice given by the insureds in that case says nothing about whether the Truck policy covers the insureds for the bodily injury they allegedly caused to Amey.</p>\n<p>[8]  Moreover, Amey claimed the insureds caused him emotional and physical distress by conduct that did not cause any accompanying economic loss. Amey testified at his deposition in his lawsuit against the insureds that the insureds had humiliated him by cutting his office telephone lines, packing his belongings and putting them out on the sidewalk, and humiliating him in front of a client. None of these acts caused economic loss to Amey. As I have noted previously, the insureds renewed their tender of defense on the basis of Amey's deposition testimony.\n</p>\n<p>This case presents other distinctions as well from <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>. Unlike <i>Chatton,</i> here there was physical injury accompanying the emotional distress. Also unlike <i>Chatton,</i> here the Truck policy defines \"occurrence\" in terms of events, not accidents.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Court of Appeal below concluded that allegations of incidental emotional distress damages flowing from noncovered causes of action fall outside the scope of a commercial (formerly called comprehensive) general liability (CGL) policy and present no potential for coverage under the policy. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal reasoned, because there is no potential for coverage, there is no duty to defend on the part of the insurer. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168] [hereafter <em>Gray].) </em>The Court of Appeal also concluded that if the insurer is under no obligation to defend or indemnify the third party action, it cannot be found liable for either statutory bad faith (Ins.

The declarations page of the T.I.E. policy identified Marmac as the named insured, and contained an endorsement naming Lester Amey, among others, as a named insured.

The policy defined an \u201coccurrence\u201d \u201cas an event, or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by the act or omission which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers), as T.I.E.\u2019s adjuster, was responsible for handling claims filed by T.I.E. insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Prior to August 29, 1986, plaintiff Waller, Marmac\u2019s president, owned 60 percent of Marmac stock. Amey, Marmac\u2019s executive vice-president, owned 40 percent. On August 29, 1986, Waller sold his stock in equal proportions to employees Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple. Thereafter, Waller resigned from Marmac\u2019s board, and Hendrix and Hepple were elected to the board, with Amey remaining as the third member. Akers subsequently became president of the company, and Hendrix, Hepple and Petersen became vice-presidents. Amey was thereafter demoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Amey sued Marmac, Waller, and the four Marmac officers under 11 causes of action: involuntary dissolution (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1800, subd. (b)(4) &amp; (5)); breach of fiduciary duty; breach of statutory duty of good faith <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 309); interference with prospective economic advantage; breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; inducing breach of contract; conspiracy; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and injunctive relief. The first amended complaint included allegations that Marmac\u2019s board of directors was \u201cguilty of or have knowingly countenanced acts of persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority and persistent unfairness toward Amey,\u201d and that they excluded \u201cAmey from any voice in the management [of Marmac]\u201d to deprive him of a controlling block of stock in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the corporation and in order to \u201cgain a controlling interest in and to freeze Amey, a minority shareholder, out of the corporation.\u201d Amey also accused the management of Marmac of \u201cself-dealing in voting themselves substantial increases in salary, and causing [Marmac] to enter into an unreasonable or sham contract of employment with [Waller].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Amey also accused Waller of disregarding and breaching his fiduciary duties to Amey, failing \u201cto exercise good faith and due care so as to avoid unfairness to [Amey] by entering into a transaction to dispose of his dominant or control block of stock in [Marmac] without the slightest regard to the wishes and interests, and without prior knowledge of [Amey], and for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the sale or transfer of said controlling block of shares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Amey\u2019s 10th cause of action alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress against Waller and the Marmac officers, and claimed that because of their conduct, Amey \u201csuffered humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d Amey alleged that as fiduciaries, Waller and the Marmac officers\u2019 conduct leading up to the involuntary dissolution and wrongful termination as alleged in the complaint \u201cwas outrageous, went beyond all reasonable bounds of decency, was intentional and malicious and was done for the purpose of causing [Amey] to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d In making these allegations, Amey did not include Marmac as a named defendant, but nonetheless incorporated all allegations of corporate misconduct and financial detriment into the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">One week after the Amey suit was filed, Robert Kull, Marmac\u2019s corporate attorney, wrote T.I.E. at its home office requesting the insurer defend the Amey lawsuit on behalf of all defendants. About three weeks latter, the letter was forwarded to Farmers\u2019 regional liability claims manager in Santa Ana. The claims manager sought an in-house coverage opinion, but did not act on the defense question. That issue was forwarded to Farmers\u2019 Anaheim branch claims office. Richard Neisser, manager of the Anaheim office, tentatively concluded that the complaint alleged a noncovered business dispute. He discussed the matter with William Vaughter, a claims representative, and instructed Vaughter to investigate the loss and to verify whether the Amey complaint had been served. Vaughter told Hendrix around December 10 or 11, 1986, that he was going to process the claim for payment. According to Hendrix, Vaughter then asked whether he was pleased with his counsel because Farmers could provide counsel if he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On December 29, 1986, the insureds forwarded to Vaughter the total billing (in the amount of $54,000) for attorney fees incurred in defending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the Amey lawsuit. Neisser directed Vaughter to (1) \u201ctransmit to [in house counsel] after you have called and discussed, among other things, whether the insurer owes a defense and whether there is an obligation under <em>[San Diego Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Cumis Ins. Society, Inc. </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 358, 364 (208 Cal.Rptr. 494)], (2) send a reservation of rights letter and (3) make up an office file.\u201d Neisser concluded, based on the allegations of the complaint, that the policy did not provide coverage for Amey\u2019s claims. Neisser then instructed Vaughter to contact in-house counsel, who advised Vaughter to deny the claim. Neisser prepared an evaluation recommending \u201cno coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The regional claims manager (Eastman) concurred in Neisser\u2019s decision that the CGL policy did not provide coverage under the allegations of the Amey complaint. Eastman based his decision on the following factors: (1) Amey\u2019s complaint did not state an occurrence within the policy insuring clause because Amey was not claiming bodily injury or property damage, and any economic injuries he suffered were expected or intended from the standpoint of the insureds; (2) the policy endorsement listed Amey as a named insured and the policy expressly excluded coverage for liability to named insureds; and (3) Amey was a Marmac employee, and the policy excluded coverage for bodily injury suffered by Marmac employees arising out of and in the course of employment. Eastman testified that the amount of attorney fees already incurred did not influence his decision to recommend a denial of coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In January 1987, Eastman directed Neisser: \u201cPlease deny the insureds\u2019 request with an appropriate response outlining specifically that since no coverage is available under the policy contract, nothing can be considered as far as any payment is concerned.\u201d Neisser sent the insureds the following denial letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u201cWe have received your claim for attorney fees in the Lester H. Amey v. Marmac [case]. Accordingly, we have reviewed your policy in its entirety, spoken to your agent, obtained the opinion of our house counsel and submitted the entire packet of information to our Regional Office for a decision regarding whether this loss is covered under your policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u201cThe claim against Marmac is essentially a shareholder dispute regarding intentional acts committed by Marmac and their principles [sic]. Intentional Acts are not covered under your Sentinel business policy or any endorsements taken out by Marmac. Accordingly we are unable to make payment for legal expenses incurred by Marmac in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Marmac\u2019s counsel asked for reconsideration of the denial, asserting that Amey\u2019s amended complaint created a potential for coverage under the CGL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>policy. The request was forwarded to the regional office, and the office confirmed the \u201cno coverage\u201d decision. Thereafter, Waller, Marmac, and the Marmac officers successfully defended the Amey action.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Between May and August of 1987, Waller, Marmac, and the four individual defendants filed separate lawsuits against T.I.E. and Farmers, alleging causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation. All plaintiffs sought both compensatory and punitive damages. Waller amended his pleading to substitute Farmers, Farmers Group, Inc., and Truck Underwriters Association for several Does. (Waller later dismissed the latter two entities from his complaint.) Marmac and the other plaintiffs amended their pleadings to substitute Farmers as a party. Two years later the three actions were consolidated and the parties filed second amended complaints, the subject of this proceeding. Only Waller\u2019s second amended complaint alleged a cause of action for statutory bad faith pursuant to Insurance Code section 790.03. Marmac, Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple amended their complaints to include a section 790.03 cause of action following the close of evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">After the trial court denied a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by T.I.E. and Farmers, the parties tried the legal issues to the court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 592.) The court ruled that (1) Amey\u2019s first amended complaint \u201calleges facts potentially within bodily injury coverage\u201d of the T.I.E. policy; (2) as a matter of law, \u201cthe occurrence clause in [the policy] gives rise to a duty to defend in this case\u201d; (3) T.I.E.\u2019s letter to Marmac denying coverage \u201cwaived policy based defenses not specified therein\u201d; and (4) Insurance Code section 533, disallowing coverage for the insured\u2019s \u201cwillful\u201d acts, did not excuse T.I.E. from its duty to defend under the policy. The trial court concluded: \u201c[T]he logical conclusions of all the findings made so far, [is that] as a matter of law you had a duty to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Following plaintiffs\u2019 opening statements in the jury trial, the trial court granted motions for nonsuit filed by T.I.E. and Farmers on the following causes of action: breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, deceit and negligent misrepresentation, as well as claims by Marmac and Hendrix, Petersen, Akers, and Hepple regarding allegations that T.I.E.\u2019s failure to defend the Amey lawsuit prejudiced their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions for partial directed verdict that T.I.E. breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that Farmers was jointly and severally liable with T.I.E. for the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">After concluding that both T.I.E. and Farmers violated Insurance Code section 790.03, the jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>following approximate amounts: to Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple, the jury awarded $89,000 for the cost of defending the Amey lawsuit. Marmac received contract damages in the amount of $349,000 and attorney fees in the amount of $390,000. (See <em>Brandt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 813 [210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796] [allowing attorney fees for tortious breach of insurance contract].) The jury awarded Waller contract damages of $144,000, attorney fees of $334,000, lost consulting fees of $227,500 and emotional distress damages of $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">After originally being deadlocked on the punitive damages issue, the jury returned a nine-to-three verdict in favor of such damages. It awarded Waller $27 million in punitive damages against Farmers, and $3 million in punitive damages against T.I.E. Marmac received punitive damages totaling $26 million, and Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple received a total of $4 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On motions for new trial filed by T.I.E. and Farmers, the court ordered the judgment corrected to eliminate Farmers\u2019 liability for policy benefits. The court also ruled that the punitive damages awarded to Hendrix, Akers, Petersen, and Hepple were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Both T.I.E. and Farmers appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the entire judgment after concluding that T.LE.\u2019s CGL policy did not provide coverage under the allegations of the Amey complaint. The Court of Appeal concluded that because Amey\u2019s alleged emotional and physical distress flowed from noncovered economic loss, there was no potential for coverage and hence no duty to defend the plaintiffs against the Amey lawsuit. The Court of Appeal summarized its holding as follows: \u201cClearly, the Amey lawsuit sets forth nothing more than a business dispute; the torts alleged in the suit are all business and contract transgressions. Simply put, the gravamen of the Amey lawsuit is economic loss. In our view, the damages claim for emotional and physical distress is clearly derivative of and caused by the economic loss suffered by Amey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">We conclude the Court of Appeal correctly analyzed the duty to defend and coverage issues under authority from our state and federal courts. Moreover, the finding of no duty to defend in this context is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties when they enter into a contract for commercial general liability insurance, for it is widely understood by both insureds and insurers that such policies are not intended to cover economic losses. As we explain, the damages alleged in Amey\u2019s complaint flowed from intangible property losses that could not be considered covered occurrences under the CGL policy. Likewise, the derivative emotional distress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>damages sought by Amey for the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged business torts were not covered because they flowed from the same noncovered acts. Any damages flowing from noncovered losses that may lead to emotional distress cannot be used to expand coverage where none was intended or bargained for by the parties. <em>(Keating </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 154, 156-157 [hereafter Keating]; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1150-1151 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 559] [hereafter McLaughlin].) We begin our analysis with an explanation of a third party CGL policy and its intended coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">A. <em>The Commercial General Liability Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In pertinent part, a CGL policy, often referred to as a business general liability policy, provides liability insurance for businesses. The policy is written in two essential parts: the insuring agreement, which states the risk or risks covered by the policy, and the exclusion clauses, which remove coverage for risks that would otherwise fall within the insuring clause. <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 802 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 391].) Before \u201ceven considering exclusions, a court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether a claim falls within [the policy terms].\u201d <em>(Hallmark Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1014, 1017 [247 Cal.Rptr. 638].) \u201cThis is significant for two reasons. First, \u2018. . . when an occurrence is clearly not included within the coverage afforded by the insuring clause, it need not also be specifically excluded.\u2019 <em>(Glavinich </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 263, 270 [209 Cal.Rptr. 266].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u201cSecond, although exclusions are construed narrowly and must be proven by the insurer, the burden is on the insured to bring the claim within the basic scope of coverage, and (unlike exclusions) courts will not indulge in a forced construction of the policy\u2019s insuring clause to bring a claim within the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 803.) Accordingly, the insured has the burden of showing that there has been an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the terms of the policy. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The CGL policy restricts coverage to damages \u201ccaused by an occurrence,\u201d which, in standard pre-1986 policies, was defined as an \u201caccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Although more recent policies (including T.I.E.\u2019s policy) have replaced the term \u201caccident\u201d with \u201cevent\u201d (to include gradual events within the concept of accident), the phrase \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d focuses coverage on <em>unexpected </em>or <em>accidental injuries </em>that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>fortuitous and not planned or intended. This concept of fortuity is basic to insurance law. <em>(Chu </em>v. <em>Canadian Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 86, 94-95 [274 Cal.Rptr. 20] <em>(Chu).) </em>Insurance typically is designed to protect against contingent or unknown risks of harm (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 250), not to protect against harm that is certain or expected. <em>(Chu, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at pp. 94-95.) In other words, such insurance generally protects against risks of loss rather than certainties of loss. <em>(Ibid:, </em>see e.g., <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 747 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] [the phrase \u201cexpected or intended\u201d precludes coverage for damage that the insured subjectively intended to be a result of its conduct, as well as damage that it in fact subjectively foresaw as practically certain to be a result of its conduct].)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Standard CGL policies define bodily injury to mean: \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease [including death at any time resulting therefrom] sustained by any person.\u201d (3 Keller &amp; Golub, Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1995) ch. 49, General Liability Policies, \u00a749.14[1], pp. 49-27 to 49-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The property loss section of the standard policy provides coverage for \u201cphysical injury or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy term.\" The focus of coverage for property damage is therefore the property itself, and does not include intangible economic losses, violation of antitrust laws or nonperformance of contractual obligations. (See, e.g., <em>Gulf Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>L.A. Effects Group, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 827 F.2d 574, 578 [no coverage under business general liability policy for insured\u2019s alleged nonperformance of contractual obligations to create special visual effects for motion picture]; <em>Lassen Canyon Nursery </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 720 F.2d 1016, 1018 [business liability policy for property damage does not cover claims for strictly economic losses caused by insured\u2019s alleged antitrust violations]; <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 303 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] [recognizing that \u201ca suit seeking recovery for injuries to intangible economic interests is not a suit \u2018of the nature and kind\u2019 covered by a CGL policy\u201d]; <em>Chatton </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 846 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 318] [hereafter Chatton] [ruling there was no coverage for emotional distress damages resulting from investment losses caused by negligent misrepresentation]; <em>Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213, 217 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278] [hereafter Giddings] [no coverage for intangible economic interests, including breach of securities laws and fraud].) As <em>Giddings </em>observed, \u201cstrictly economic losses like lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of the anticipated benefit of a bargain, and loss of an investment, do not constitute damage or injury to tangible property covered by a comprehensive general liability policy. [Citations.] A complaint seeking to recover damages of this nature from an insured falls within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the scope of the insurance coverage only where these intangible economic losses provide \u2018a measure of damages to physical property which is within the policy\u2019s coverage.\u2019 [Citations].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Finally, by statute, and as a matter of public policy, the insurer may not provide coverage for willful injuries by the insured against a third party. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>The Interpretation of Insurance Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">When determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend, we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>(AIU Ins. Co </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 818 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] [hereafter <em>AIU].) </em>The rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638; <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764] [hereafter <em>Reserve </em>Insurance].) Thus, in determining whether allegations in a particular complaint give rise to coverage under a CGL policy, courts must consider both the occurrence language in the policy, and the endorsements broadening coverage, if any, included in the policy terms. <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the \u201cmutual intention\u201d of the parties. \u201cUnder statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1639.) The \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. (I<em>d., </em>\u00a7 1638.)\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] [hereafter <em>Bank of the West].) A </em>policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. <em>(Bay Cities Paving Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Insurance Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 867 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263].) But language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. <em>(Bank of the West, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1265.) Courts will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>strain to create an ambiguity where none exists. <em>(Reserve Insurance, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">These well-established precepts of insurance coverage guide us in our determination of whether a particular policy requires a liability insurer to defend a lawsuit filed by a third party against the insured.  It has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276; see also <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 295.) This duty, which applies even to claims that are \u201cgroundless, false, or fraudulent,\u201d is separate from and broader than the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 273-275.) However, \u201c \u2018where there is no possibility of coverage, there is no duty to defend ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Fire Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1012, 1029 [251 Cal.Rptr. 620].) <em>Gray </em>and its progeny have made it clear that the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276; <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 44 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048] [test is whether underlying action for which defense is sought potentially seeks relief within policy terms].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Conversely, where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage, the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability. <em>(Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 256, 263 [224 Cal.Rptr. 493]; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt </em>(1973) 17 Cal.App.3d 538, 548-549 [95 Cal.Rptr. 296].) This is because the duty to defend, although broad, is not unlimited; it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 274; <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 218.) With these principles in mind, we proceed with our discussion of T.I.E.\u2019s duties to plaintiffs under its CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">B. <em>T.I.E.\u2019s Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The T.I.E. CGL policy insuring language was standard. The company agreed to \u201cpay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of. . . bodily injury to any person, and . . . damage to property ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d Bodily injury was defined as \u201csickness or disease\u201d and property damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>meant \u201cphysical injury or destruction of tangible property.\u201d The T.I.E. policy also contained the standard exclusions for \u201cbodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured,\u201d and for \u201cthe liability of any insured for bodily injury to . . . the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean \u201can event, or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by the act or omission which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Thus, to demonstrate a potential for coverage under T.I.E.\u2019s policy, an insured must show the claim he must defend is an alleged act or omission that caused bodily injury or tangible property damage (as defined by the policy) to the third party, and that the alleged injury was neither expected nor intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The first issue we address is whether, under the insuring language and definitions of the liability policy, T.I.E. owed a duty to defend plaintiffs against Amey\u2019s lawsuit based on the fact that T.I.E.\u2019s CGL policy provided coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d and \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In reversing the trial court judgment, the Court of Appeal focused on the fact that Amey\u2019s complaint alleged emotional and physical distress flowing from an uncovered economic loss. The appellate court found no duty to defend the underlying lawsuit because the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the complaint was economic loss. It found the damages for emotional and physical distress were derivative of and inseparable from Amey\u2019s allegations of intentional and business torts, allegations that could not, by themselves, give rise to coverage under a CGL policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The Court of Appeal relied principally on three cases (including two cases decided after the trial in the present matter) to conclude that T.I.E. had no duty to defend the Amey action because plaintiffs\u2019 alleged misconduct (as asserted in the Amey complaint) was not potentially covered by the T.I.E. policy. <em>(Keating, supra, </em>995 F.2d at pp. 156-157; <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1150-1151; <em>Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In <em>Keating, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the issue whether, under California law, an insurer had a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defend its insureds against an investor action alleging that the insureds\u2019 conduct in committing securities fraud and other related claims had caused the plaintiff investors to suffer economic damages that, in turn, resulted in their suffering from \u201c \u2018emotional and physical distress, and impairment of health.\u2019 \u201d (995 F.2d at p. 156.) The court held the insurer owed no duty to defend the underlying investor lawsuits because the alleged emotional and physical distress flowed from economic losses, which were not covered by the CGL policy and therefore did not give rise to a duty to defend. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The <em>Keating </em>court relied on <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Interbank Financial Services </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 825 [264 Cal.Rptr. 25] (hereafter <em>Allstate), </em>which denied coverage under a CGL policy for bodily injury in a lawsuit alleging that an investment firm had conspired to convince third party plaintiffs to make unsound investments. In reaching its conclusion, the <em>Allstate </em>court held that \u201c[t]he [liability] policy covers losses resulting from accidental events which cause bodily injury or property damage, not the giving of professional or investment advice. . . . Here, although the insureds attempt to characterize the claims differently, the clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice and the plaintiffs lost money in a tax shelter investment. [&lt;][| Had these insureds desired to obtain a professional liability policy to protect them from charges resulting from the performance of professional services, such insurance could have been obtained [at a higher premium]. . . . [J]ust as an insurer would not reasonably expect that a [CGL] policy would cover claims for securities fraud, these insureds could not reasonably expect that such claims would be covered under this policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 830-831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As in <em>Allstate, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pages 830-831, the <em>Keating </em>court recognized that economic or business loss \u201cof the sort alleged by the investors\u201d is not a covered loss within the meaning of a standard CGL policy. Nor, in the <em>Keating </em>court\u2019s view, is emotional and physical distress induced by (or derivative of) the economic loss a covered event. As the court observed, \u201cIt would expand coverage of these policies far beyond any reasonable expectation of the parties to sweep within their potential coverage any alleged emotional or physical distress that might result from economic loss that is itself clearly outside the scope of the policy.\u201d <em>(Keating, supra, </em>995 F.2d at p.156.) For this latter statement, the <em>Keating </em>court relied on <em>Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846, a coverage case that is nonetheless applicable to our duty to defend discussion because the court concluded that a CGL policy does not provide a potential for coverage for allegations based on economic losses and emotional distress flowing from those losses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In <em>Chatton, </em>several investors sued the directors and officers of Technical Equities, an investment services company, for fraud, negligent misrepresen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tation, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The investors prevailed on their negligence and fraud causes of action and were awarded damages for both their economic losses and resulting emotional distress, as well as punitive damages. Following their success at trial, the investors filed a declaratory relief action against the company\u2019s liability insurer to adjudicate coverage. The trial court held, among other things, that there was coverage under the bodily injury clause because the investors\u2019 emotional distress constituted \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the CGL policy, and that the wrongful activities of Technical Equities (i.e., security manipulations, note fraud, etc.) were \u201coccurrences\u201d within the meaning of the same policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that any emotional distress suffered by the investors due to their economic losses was not covered by the liability policy even though those losses were caused by the negligent misrepresentations of Technical Equities officers and directors. (See <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1029 [281 Cal.Rptr. 635]; <em>Allstate, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 825; <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213; <em>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 272, 279 [142 Cal.Rptr. 681].) This is so, the court held, because the \u201cbodily injury\u201d clause under a CGL policy \u201cprovides coverage for bodily injury to the person and for physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, <em>tangible </em>property.\u201d <em>(Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 857, some italics omitted.) Recognizing that the investors\u2019 emotional distress claims were \u201cpredicated upon the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 clause of the CGL policy,\u201d the court concluded that the emotional trauma suffered by the investors was caused by investment or <em>intangible </em>economic losses which, in turn, were caused by the negligent misrepresentations of the Technical Equities officers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 860.) The emotional trauma, the court concluded, fell outside the coverage clauses of the CGL policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The present Court of Appeal also relied on <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1150, another case involving Technical Equities officers and directors, decided after the <em>Keating </em>and <em>Chatton </em>cases. One issue in <em>McLaughlin </em>was whether the. insurer had a duty to defend against an action alleging that the insureds\u2019 conduct had caused the investor plaintiffs to suffer economic damages and resultant mental, physical and emotional distress. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>McLaughlin </em>court followed the reasoning of <em>Keating, supra, </em>995 F.2d 154, and <em>Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846, to reverse a multimillion-dollar, bad faith judgment against Technical Equities\u2019s insurer, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., and to conclude the insurer owed no duty to defend under the bodily injury and property damage clauses because none of the damages sought was allowed under the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The <em>McLaughlin </em>court observed, \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 physical and emotional distress derived from their investment loss which in turn was negligently inflicted upon them by the insureds. First, the property damage coverage under the CGL extends only to physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, \u2018tangible property.\u2019 Damage for lost profits, loss of investment or other harm to one\u2019s economic interest constitute injuries to <em>intangible </em>property which by definition fall outside the scope of the [CGL] policy. <em>(Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 857-858.) [&lt;]\u25a1 Second, since [plaintiffs\u2019 physical distress was induced by an uncovered economic loss it defies reason that bodily injury coverage would nevertheless independently obtain.\u201d <em>(McLaughlin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1150, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeal below that <em>Keating, Chatton, </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>properly determined that CGL policies do not provide coverage for economic losses that cause emotional distress. As we have observed, the CGL policy provides coverage for \u201coccurrences\u201d that cause bodily injury or tangible property losses. <em>(Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 217.) These policies were never intended to cover emotional distress damages that flow from an uncovered \u201coccurrence,\u201d and the parties could not reasonably have expected that coverage would be expanded merely because a claim of emotional or physical distress is alleged as a result of the economic loss. <em>(Keating, supra, </em>995 F.2d at p. 157, fn.1.) Accordingly, when we apply this rule to the present case and look to the allegations of the Amey complaint compared with the terms of T.I.E.\u2019s CGL policy, we conclude that T.I.E. owed no duty to defend the Amey lawsuit. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) All allegations in the Amey complaint were related to Amey\u2019s asserted <em>economic loss </em>as a Marmac shareholder, and, as T.I.E. noted in its denial letter, shareholder disputes are not covered by its policy. In sum, the allegations of the Amey complaint, liberally construed, did not assert a risk potentially covered under T.I.E.\u2019s CGL policy. Nonetheless, plaintiffs make several procedural arguments urging this court to recognize a duty to defend based on the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">First, plaintiffs contend that T.I.E. and Farmers should not be allowed to rely on either <em>Keating or McLaughlin, or </em>their theory of no coverage for economic losses, because those cases were not decided until after the trial in the present matter was complete. Moreover, plaintiffs contend the \u201ceconomic loss\u201d issue cannot be considered because it was not raised in the trial court or in the regular briefing in the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Both arguments fail. As T.I.E. and Farmers observe, Courts of Appeal routinely consider newly published case law that was not available until after entry of judgment in the trial court. (See, e.g., <em>Hattersley </em>v. <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Nucleonics Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 397, 402 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 331] [rejecting claim that appellant should be foreclosed from relying on theory of law espoused in newly decided Court of Appeal opinion]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29.3(a) [\u201cWhen a party desires to present new authorities . . . not available in time to have been included in the party\u2019s brief on the merits, the party may serve and file a supplemental brief . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Moreover, after the <em>Keating </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>cases were decided, T.I.E. (and Farmers) sought, and obtained permission, to file supplemental briefs. As the Court of Appeal observed, supplemental briefing is proper when a court wishes to consider a point of law following the regular briefing of a case on appeal. (See <em>Meier </em>v. <em>Ross General Hospital </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 420, 423-424, fn. 1 [71 Cal.Rptr. 903, 445 P.2d 519]; <em>Kievlan </em>v. <em>Dahlberg Electronics, Inc. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 951, 957, fn. 5 [144 Cal.Rptr. 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Second, as T.I.E., Farmers, and the Court of Appeal observe, the duty to defend issue involves a question of law based on undisputed facts. Under settled law, the Court of Appeal had discretion to address the issue even though it had not been raised in the trial court. <em>(Canaan </em>v. <em>Abelnour </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 703, 733, fn. 17 [221 Cal.Rptr. 468, 710 P.2d 268, 69 A.L.R.4th 915]; see <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736, 742 [336 P.2d 534] [new theory pertaining to question of law on facts appearing in the record may be raised for the first time on appeal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In a related context, plaintiffs assert the Court of Appeal should not have applied <em>Keating </em>or <em>McLaughlin </em>\u201cretroactively\u201d because both cases represent new law that should not be used to justify T.I.E.\u2019s denial of a defense to the Amey action. Plaintiffs also claim that any uncertainty on legal questions of policy interpretation compels a defense of a third party lawsuit until the issue is resolved by controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">These claims ignore the general rule that judicial decisions are to be applied retroactively. <em>(Newman </em>v. <em>Emerson Radio Corp. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 973, 978-982 [258 Cal.Rptr. 592, 772 P.2d 1059] [\u201cgeneral rule that judicial decisions are given retroactive effect is basic to our legal tradition\u201d]; <em>Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1207 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585] [relying on general rule of retroactive application of judicial decisions]; see also <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Dept, of Taxation </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 86, 96 [125 L.Ed.2d 74, 86, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 2517] (hereafter <em>Harper) </em>[stating that in general, civil decisions \u201cmust be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Notwithstanding the general rule on retroactive application of case law, plaintiffs assert that neither <em>Keating </em>nor <em>McLaughlin </em>should apply to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>bad faith action because they relied on <em>pre-Keating </em>law \u201cin deciding what facts needed to be explored in the Amey suit.\u201d Plaintiffs also assert that <em>Keating </em>was an unforseeable decision, and retroactive application of its holding would be contrary to the public policy behind the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Similar arguments were rejected by the high court in <em>Harper, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 96 [125 L.Ed.2d at p. 86, 113 S.Ct. at p. 2517]. The <em>Harper </em>court found unmeritorious the argument that a court should consider the equities of each individual case in deciding the question of retroactivity. (Cf. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Emerson Radio Corp., supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 986-987.) Moreover, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Keating </em>was not new law; rather it was a clarification of the law as it existed when plaintiffs tendered their defense to T.I.E. Thus, T.I.E. may rely on <em>Keating </em>to defend the position it took at the time of tender, and its position here, that there was no possibility of coverage under the facts alleged or otherwise known to T.I.E. Indeed, the <em>Keating </em>decision was but a logical extension of the principle, well established at the time T.I.E. denied a defense in the Amey action (see e.g., <em>Lassen Canyon Nursery, supra, </em>720 F.2d 1016, 1018; <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213, 219; <em>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc., supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.3d 272, 279), that a CGL policy does not cover intangible economic loss. <em>(Keating, supra, </em>995 F.2d at p. 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 related claim, that the lack of authority on the duty to defend issue required a defense by T.I.E. of the Amey lawsuit because \u201cuncertainty of policy interpretation compels a duty to defend in this case,\u201d is equally unmeritorious. Plaintiffs misinterpret <em>CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 598, 605 [222 Cal.Rptr. 276] (hereafter <em>CNA Casualty) </em>(criticized on other grounds in <em>Montrose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 297, 298). <em>CNA Casualty </em>held that: \u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend must be analyzed and determined on the basis of any <em>potential </em>liability arising from facts available to the insurer from the complaint or other sources available to it at the time of the tender of defense.\u201d (176 Cal.App.3d at p. 605, italics in original.) As the Court of Appeal below observed, <em>CNA Casualty </em>simply recites the settled rule that the insurer must look to the facts of the complaint and extrinsic evidence, if available, to determine whether there is a potential for coverage under the policy and a corresponding duty to defend. <em>CNA Casualty </em>does not hold, as plaintiffs suggest, that the insurer must always defend a third party lawsuit absent a published judicial opinion definitively construing the specific policy provision on which the insurer relies, or, as plaintiffs assert, \u201cuntil the extent of \u2018the policy coverage\u2019 is legally certain,\u201d to deny the defense. This has never been the law. (See, e.g., <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1152 [duty to defend depends on facts in complaint; where only potential for liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>turns on resolution of legal question, there is no duty to defend]; citing <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Longden </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 226, 233 [242 Cal.Rptr. 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">As plaintiffs themselves observe, the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) If the terms of the policy provide no potential for coverage, as in this case, the insurer acts properly in denying a defense even if that duty is later evaluated under case law that did not exist at the time of the defense tender. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213; see also <em>Coit Drapery Cleaners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1595, 1608-1609 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 692] [affirming summary judgment for insurer based on numerous cases decided after insurer refused to defend]; <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Peoples Church of Fresno </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 446, 448-451 [applying <em>Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1254, to relieve insurers of obligation to defend action pending when <em>Bank of the West </em>was decided].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Here, the terms of the policy provided coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d meaning an event proximately caused by the insured\u2019s act or omission that causes either bodily injury or tangible property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. The event in this case that led to Amey\u2019s complaint was the purposeful conduct of Waller and Marmac in allegedly mismanaging Marmac property, manipulating the value of Marmac stock, disregarding Amey\u2019s rights as a minority shareholder, violating the corporate bylaws, interfering with Amey\u2019s prospective economic advantage and inducing Waller to breach his stock-sale contract with Amey. This .conduct, according to plaintiffs eventually resulted in financial detriment to Amey and was the reason he suffered \u201chumiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d Thus, the alleged policy \u201coccurrence\u201d under which T.I.E. evaluated coverage was based entirely on economic acts or events that resulted in economic injury and mental and physical damages to Amey. At no point did Amey allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d that could have triggered liability and thus a duty to defend, i.e., an event based on a noneconomic act causing either emotional distress or bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Plaintiffs claim that the \u201cplain meaning of the words [in the insuring clause] would lead the insured to reasonably expect the insurer to defend him against suits seeking damages for bodily injuries caused by an occurrence as defined.\u201d This argument is misleading, for it ignores the fact that the occurrence or act leading to coverage must be an injury to tangible property, not to one\u2019s economic interest. It is well established that CGL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>policies do not provide coverage for intangible property losses, including economic losses. <em>(Chatton, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846, 850; <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213.) Both <em>Keating </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>apply the <em>Chatton </em>and <em>Giddings </em>rule, notwithstanding the fact that the insureds in those cases alleged both mental and physical distress caused by the economic occurrence. Because the alleged \u201coccurrence\u201d here was the creation of economic loss to Amey, harmful enough to result in his removal from the company, there is no potential for coverage and no corresponding duty to defend under the policy, regardless of the damages allegedly suffered by Amey as a result of that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Plaintiffs next criticize <em>Chatton </em>(and, indirectly, <em>Keating </em>and McLaughlin) for creating an \u201ceconomic loss\u201d exclusion by allegedly confusing the definitions of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d as they appeared in the CGL policy. This \u201ceconomic loss exclusion,\u201d plaintiffs claim, \u201cis an unwarranted expansion and attenuation of the holding in <em>Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213,\u201d which simply held that purely economic losses do not constitute tangible property losses under a CGL policy. <em>(Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 218-219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Plaintiffs claim that <em>Chatton </em>created an \u201ceconomic loss\u201d exclusion by erroneously eliminating the separate and independent nature of \u201cbodily injury\u201d coverage and \u201cproperty damage\" coverage in a CGL policy. They argue that <em>Chatton </em>would require covered property damage as a prerequisite to bodily injury and thereby eviscerate the separate and independent coverage for bodily injury resulting from an occurrence, and criticize Chatton\u2019s reliance on cases defining \u201ctangible property loss.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Allstate, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 825, 830 [economic or contractual losses not tangible property losses in CGL policy]; <em>Kruse </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 38, 67 [248 Cal.Rptr. 217] [emotional distress damages not recoverable as element of fraud].)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeal that plaintiffs\u2019 criticism of the <em>Chatton </em>analysis is unwarranted. As the Court of Appeal observed, when the third party complaint alleges emotional and/or physical distress flowing from economic losses\u2014as was the case in <em>Chatton, Keating, </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>as well as in the present lawsuit\u2014the occurrence or event that causes damages is an economic loss. There is no separate \u201cbodily injury\u201d occurrence within the terms of the policy. Thus, the injured party\u2019s claim that he suffered incidental emotional distress flows directly from the economic occurrence and, hence, is not covered by the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">As the Court of Appeal also noted, the result reached by the courts in <em>Chatton, Keating, </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties when they enter into an insurance contract for CGL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>coverage. It is simply not within the intent of parties to a CGL contract that the \u201cbodily injury\u201d provision would require the insurer to defend a third party lawsuit in which uncovered economic loss is the gravamen of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Chatton, Keating, </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>on the ground that the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the T.I.E. policy is different from the standard definition found in the policies governing the above cases. In the T.I.E. policy, the word \u201caccident\u201d is absent from the definition of \u201coccurrence,\u201d and there is no modifying language for \u201cevent or series of events\u201d in the occurrence clause. Plaintiffs claim this indicates that the volitional nature of the occurrence or event leading to coverage is irrelevant, and the T.I.E. policy therefore potentially covers intentional or purposeful acts. Plaintiffs rely on <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1560, 1564 [281 Cal.Rptr. 375] (hereafter <em>United Pacific) </em>to support their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The issue in <em>United Pacific, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at page 1563, was whether a plaintiff\u2019s claim of wrongful termination that allegedly resulted in mental distress was an \u201cevent\u201d within the meaning of a policy endorsement that defined \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018an accident, an event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the insured.\u2019 \u201d (Italics omitted.) The <em>United Pacific </em>court held that the expanded policy \u201cdefinition of occurrence provides coverage for intentional actions (subject to the statutory limitations of Ins. Code, \u00a7 533) that result in bodily injury but excludes coverage for those elements of <em>damages </em>that were expected or intended by the insured.\u201d <em>(United Pacific, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1566, italics added.) Thus, the defendants were covered for the intentional act of terminating the plaintiff, as long as the result of the termination \u2014i.e., emotional distress\u2014was not intended by the defendants. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Plaintiffs assert that <em>United Pacific </em>supports their argument for a duty to defend in cases involving intentional economic torts that lead to emotional distress. The argument is misplaced. First, in contrast to the present case, the <em>United Pacific </em>court did not question whether coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes incidental emotional distress damages that may flow from a non-covered loss. In addition, as the Court of Appeal below observed, the issue we address does not focus on whether plaintiffs\u2019 actions toward Amey were intentional; thus, this difference in the policy language is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Finally, plaintiffs assert that the Court of Appeal disregarded the rule set forth by this court in <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>1076 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792] (hereafter <em>Horace Mann). </em>There, a student sued her teacher primarily for sexual misconduct, but included allegations of negligence in her complaint. The defendant\u2019s general liability policy provided for coverage \u2018\u201cas a result of any claim arising out of an occurrence in the course of the insured\u2019s educational employment activities, and caused by any acts or omissions of the insured . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1079-1080.) A majority of this court held that the insurer must provide a defense under the complaint of any claim potentially covered, even though the noncovered claims predominated the action: \u201cHorace Mann contends that [defendant\u2019s] alleged misconduct apart from the molestation could not possibly give rise to liability because the admitted molestation is the \u2018dominant factor\u2019 in this case. The argument misconceives the role of the court in determining the duty to defend. We look not to whether noncovered acts predominate in the third party\u2019s action, but rather to whether there is <em>any </em>potential for liability under the policy. [Citation.] Since an insurer has a duty to defend the entire third party action if any claim encompassed within it potentially may be covered ... the mere fact that Horace Mann could not indemnify [defendant] for the molestation did not eliminate its duty to defend other, possibly covered claims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1084, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Plaintiffs are correct that the complaint for sexual misconduct in <em>Horace Mann, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at pages 1079-1080, alleged potentially covered negligent acts. By contrast, the Amey complaint alleged no potentially covered acts because all allegations were based on the occurrence of business torts, corporate mismanagement and other equally noncovered acts. Moreover, rather than predominate, the noncovered acts in this case comprised the entire complaint. Thus, the facts on which Amey based his theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress were identical business and contract transgressions on which he based the remainder of his complaint. Unlike the complaint in <em>Horace Mann, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 1076, therefore, the Amey complaint gave rise to no potential for coverage under T.LE.\u2019s CGL policy, and hence no duty to defend. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that in addition to the alleged emotional and physical distress, the Amey complaint asserted loss in reputation and humiliation that did not arise from the occurrence of economic loss and should give rise to a duty to defend under <em>Horace Mann, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 1076. This claim is equally unavailing. Plaintiffs assert that Amey\u2019s complaint arguably alleged conduct resulting in uncovered \u201cbodily injury\u201d as well as potentially covered conduct. For example, plaintiffs claim that although Amey\u2019s allegations of physical distress were generally alleged to have been caused by all of the acts set forth in the complaint, his bodily injury allegations were not specific as to \u201croot causes.\u201d Plaintiffs note that Amey\u2019s allegations were broad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>varied and alleged that plaintiffs\u2019 conduct in changing Amey\u2019s job description humiliated him in front of others. In addition, Amey alleged he was upset and distressed by being excluded from the board and shareholder meetings and the decisionmaking process. Amey was also upset that despite his implicit trust in Waller for over 16 years, Marmac\u2019s officers entered into a secret stock transaction causing Amey fear, anger, and a sense of betrayal. Indeed, plaintiffs observe, Amey was distressed because he felt he was being forced out of Marmac, a company he felt he owned and which he helped build. Plaintiffs contend that for T.I.E., Farmers, \u201cand the Court of Appeal to claim that, as a matter of law on undisputed facts, all such allegations necessarily or entirely flowed from economic loss, is, respectfully, incomprehensible. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As T.I.E., Farmers, and the Court of Appeal observe, however, any lost reputation and humiliation Amey may have suffered was, like the emotional and physical distress alleged in the Amey complaint, directly related to the uncovered business torts and economic loss. That plaintiffs\u2019 alleged business torts may have caused Amey to feel betrayed, angry or distressed, does not transform those feelings into a separate occurrence under the bodily injury clause of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">C. <em>Waiver and Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The trial court ruled that, as a matter of law, T.I.E.\u2019s denial letter of January 16, 1987, \u201cwaived policy based defenses not specified therein.\u201d On appeal, T.I.E. challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling, but the Court of Appeal declined to reach the issue after concluding there was no potential of coverage under the policy. Plaintiffs now assert that even if <em>Chatton, Keating, </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>correctly preclude coverage for emotional distress damages arising from an economic occurrence, T.I.E. nonetheless should have been required to provide a defense to the Amey action on the ground that a liability insurer that refuses to defend a suit on a specified ground impliedly waives all other nonspecified grounds it knew or would have discovered by a reasonable investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In their opening briefs, plaintiffs assert that in addition to waiver of defenses based on T.I.E.\u2019s denial letter, T.I.E.\u2019s \u201cconduct over the past seven years, particularly the failure to raise the \u2018Keating\u2019 issue in its denial letter and subsequent failure to raise the issue during litigation, evidences an objective intent to waive its right to rely on the issue.\u201d We address the waiver issue notwithstanding the Court of Appeal\u2019s refusal to do so, and despite the fact that it was not actually pleaded by plaintiffs at the trial court level, because it was a basis for the trial court\u2019s findings and is an important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>recurring issue that requires our attention. We conclude that an insurer does not impliedly waive coverage defenses it fails to mention when it denies the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">1. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">As noted above, T.I.E. denied a defense to the Amey action because it believed the CGL policy provided no potential for coverage for what its claims managers believed was essentially a \u201cshareholder dispute\u201d giving rise to uncovered \u201cintentional acts.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that because T.I.E.\u2019s denial letter failed to state specifically that the policy did not cover \u201ceconomic losses,\u201d T.I.E. waived its right to rely on <em>Keating </em>and its progeny in denying a duty to defend. In essence, we are asked to consider whether the doctrine of waiver may be invoked to create coverage for losses that the CGL policy by its terms did not cover. We address this issue, notwithstanding the antiwaiver clause in T.I.E.\u2019s policy. That clause states the insurer does not waive rights or terms under the policy in the absence of an endorsement and focuses on the terms and conditions of the policy itself, rather than on the insurer\u2019s claims practices. In sum, the clause does not affect the insured\u2019s right to assert waiver of defenses in a denial letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Case law is clear that \u201c \u2018[w]aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.\u2019 [Citations.] The burden . . . is on the party claiming a waiver of a right to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that does not leave the matter to speculation, and \u2018doubtful cases will be decided against a waiver\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(City ofUkiah </em>v. <em>Fones </em>(1962) 64 Cal.2d 104, 107-108 [48 Cal.Rptr. 865, 410 P.2d 369]; <em>DRG/Beverly Hills, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Chopstix Dim Sum Cafe &amp; Takeout III, Ltd. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 54, 60 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 515] [\u201c \u2018 \u201cWaiver always rests upon intent.\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Brookview Condominium Owners\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Heltzer EnterprisesBrookview </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 502, 512 [267 Cal.Rptr. 76]; <em>National Union Fire Ins.

The waiver may be either express, based on the words of the waiving party, or implied, based on conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right. <em>(Brookview Condominium Owners\u2019 Assn., supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">As T.I.E. observes, California courts have applied the general rule that waiver requires the insurer to intentionally relinquish its right to deny coverage and that a denial of coverage on one ground does not, absent clear and convincing evidence to suggest otherwise, impliedly waive grounds not stated in the denial. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Jioras </em>(1994) 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1619, 1628, fn. 7 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 840] [\u201cWaiver depends solely on the intent of the waiving party, and is not established merely by evidence the insurer failed to specify the exclusion in a letter reserving rights.\u201d]; cf. <em>Titan Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 457, 467 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 476]; <em>Velasquez </em>v. <em>Truck Ins.

(See, e.g., <em>Schiff Assoc, </em>v. <em>Flack </em>(1980) 51 N.Y.2d 692, 699 [435 N.Y.S.2d 972, 417 N.E.2d 84] [no waiver of coverage defenses by failure to assert them in disclaimer notice]; <em>Tobi Engineering </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut.

Titan Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty </em>&amp; <em>Surety Co. </em>(1995) 17 Ins. Litig. Rptr. 13, 19, fn. 59.) Still other states have held that the doctrine of waiver cannot be applied to expand coverage. (See, e.g., <em>Pearce </em>v. <em>American Defender Life Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 316 N.C. 461 [343 S.E.2d 174, 177].) Only one state has held that an insurer waives coverage defenses not stated in its initial denial letter. <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Hanover Insurance Company </em>(1971) 130 Vt. 182 [289 A.2d 669, 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing weight of authority, plaintiffs rely on the automatic waiver rule announced in dictum in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1983) 565 F.Supp. 434. In attempting to predict what this court would do when faced with the waiver issue, the <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life </em>court held that \u201can insurance company which relies on specified grounds for denying a claim thereby waives the right to rely in a subsequent litigation on any other grounds which a reasonable investigation would have uncovered.\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 451.) The federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>district court relied on this court\u2019s decisions recognizing the insurer\u2019s duty to conduct a reasonable investigation in order to comply with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 809 [169 Cal.Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">T.I.E. and Farmers assert <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>565 F.Supp.434, has been superseded by the Ninth Circuit decision in <em>Intel Corp. </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 952 F.2d 1551, 1559 (hereafter <em>Intel), </em>which concluded that \u201cin <em>McLaughlin </em>it was necessary to find waiver to protect insureds who had been misled by the insurer\u2019s statements as to the denial of coverage.\u201d <em>(Intel, supra, </em>952 F.2d at p. 1560.) Nonetheless, the <em>Intel </em>court rejected application of an automatic waiver rule and determined that under California law, an insurer waives defenses to coverage not asserted in its denial only if the insured can show misconduct by the insurer or detrimental reliance by the insured. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Aceves </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.Cal. 1993) 827 F.Supp. 1473, 1476-1477 [under <em>Intel </em>insurer may raise all available defenses to coverage at any time unless the insured proves detrimental reliance].) Plaintiffs urge us to reject the reasoning of <em>Intel </em>on the grounds that it (1) blurs the waiver-estoppel doctrines and erroneously applies the estoppel doctrine of detrimental reliance to issues involving waiver, (2) would preclude prompt, summary adjudication of legal issues pertinent to the meaning of the words of denial, and (3) would lead to a proliferation of bad faith lawsuits. Plaintiffs assert that the <em>McLaughlin </em>automatic waiver rule \u201cprovides an incentive for carriers to promptly disclose bases for denial [and] reduces or eliminates litigation by means of a rule easy to understand and apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\"We agree with <em>Intel, supra, </em>952 F.2d at page 1559, and decline to follow the <em>McLaughlin </em>rule of automatic waiver. A holding that an insurer waives defenses not asserted in its initial denial of a duty to defend would be inconsistent with established waiver principles by erroneously implying an intent to relinquish contract rights where no such intent existed. Such a conclusion would contradict the holdings of the majority of California and sister-state cases addressing the waiver issue. (See, e.g., <em>Velasquez </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 712, 722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> As the <em>Intel </em>court recognized, in the insurance context the terms \u201cwaiver\u201d and \u201cestoppel\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, even though estoppel requires proof of the insured\u2019s detrimental reliance. <em>(Intel, supra, </em>952 F.2d at p.1560.) Nonetheless, as the <em>Intel </em>court observed, \u201c[w]aiver is an affirmative defense, for which the insured bears the burden of proof,\u201d and \u201cCalifornia courts will find waiver when a party intentionally relinquishes a right or when that party\u2019s acts are so inconsistent with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1559.) The present facts do not show that T.I.E.\u2019s denial letter indicated an intention on the part of the insurer to relinquish additional reasons for denial of a duty to defend. Nor have plaintiffs shown that T.I.E.\u2019s actions following its defense denial were inconsistent with its intent to enforce the terms of the policy. Accordingly, plaintiffs have not shown that T.I.E.\u2019s denial of a defense induced a reasonable belief in plaintiffs that T.I.E. intended to waive additional policy defenses. To the extent <em>Alta Cal. Regional Center </em>v. <em>Fremont Indemnity Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at page 466, relies on <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life, Ins. Co., supra, </em>565 F.Supp. 434, and its rule of automatic waiver, it is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">2. <em>Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Plaintiffs also assert that notwithstanding our resolution of the <em>McLaughlin </em>waiver issue, T.I.E. should be estopped from denying a duty to defend on the basis of <em>Keating </em>and its progeny because the insurer anticipated the <em>Keating </em>decision at the time it denied a defense to the Amey action, but failed to state \u201ceconomic loss\u201d as a reason for denying a defense in its denial letter. This allegedly \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d by the insurer, plaintiffs claim, precluded plaintiffs from developing \u201cfacts [showing that] Amey\u2019s alleged bodily injury arose from causes other than economic loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">As T.I.E. observes, however, proof of estoppel requires a showing of detrimental reliance by the injured party. (See <em>State Farm Fire Casualty co. </em>v. <em>Jioras, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1627-1628; 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Equity, \u00a7 177, p. 859.) Plaintiffs do not show how they relied to their detriment on T.LE.\u2019s grounds for denial. In the absence of any such proof, plaintiffs cannot show detrimental reliance on the grounds for denial of a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In the present case, T.I.E.\u2019s letter denying a defense and coverage on the ground that the Amey complaint represented nothing more than a \u201cshareholder dispute\u201d based on \u201cintentional acts\u201d unequivocally informed plaintiffs that the insurer was denying coverage under the terms of the policy. A \u201cshareholder dispute\u201d is essentially a \u201cbusiness dispute\u201d and, in the context of the Amey allegations as set forth in the second amended complaint, would never give rise to the potential for coverage under T.LE.\u2019s CGL policy. T.LE.\u2019s denial letter thus adequately explained the factual basis for the insurer\u2019s rejection of a defense. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 2695.2, subd. (z) [insurer\u2019s denial of claim shall be in writing and shall provide factual basis of denial that is within the insurer\u2019s knowledge at the time claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>denied].) Moreover, the fact that coverage was defined in terms of an \u201cevent\u201d as opposed to an \u201caccident\u201d could in no way lead to potential coverage for business torts, whether these torts are characterized by the insured as \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cnegligent\u201d acts. As noted above, T.I.E.\u2019s CGL policy provided coverage for tangible or physical property losses and bodily injury caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Because the \u201coccurrence\u201d here was the ongoing business dispute between Amey and plaintiffs, the allegations in the Amey complaint fell outside the scope of TJ.E.\u2019s CGL coverage. <em>(Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213.) Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 alleged detrimental reliance on T.LE.\u2019s initial denial letter could not give rise to a claim for estoppel because plaintiffs never reasonably believed, nor could they reasonably believe, that the T.I.E. policy provided a potential for coverage for Amey\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">D. <em>Bad Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We next consider whether plaintiffs may state causes of action for either breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or violation of Insurance Code section 790.03 for unfair business practices, when the policy does not provide such coverage by its terms. We do so after recognizing that the present case was not final when we held that section 790.03 confers no private right of action for damages. <em>(Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 305 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58] [decision will be applied prospectively]; see also <em>Zepher Park </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 833, 837-838 [262 Cal.Rptr. 106] <em>[Moradi-Shalal </em>applies to first party actions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In its original decision, the Court of Appeal noted at the beginning of its discussion that because a contractual obligation is the underpinning of a bad faith claim, such a claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due under the contract. (See, e.g., <em>Love </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1153.) After finding that T.I.E. owed no duty to defend the Amey action, the Court of Appeal concluded that because there was no contractual liability on the part of T.I.E., plaintiffs could not assert a valid bad faith claim, <em>(id. </em>at p. 1151.) Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded, Farmers also could not be found liable for bad faith conduct. Although the court ignored the issue of T.I.E.\u2019s (and Farmers\u2019s) liability under Insurance Code section 790.03, on petition for rehearing the opinion was modified to add a citation to <em>Brodkin </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 210, 218 [265 Cal.Rptr. 710], which held that \u201cthere can be no cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith <em>or of any statutory duty\u201d </em>because the insurer defendant had properly denied the claim under the policy. (Italics added.) We agree with the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>It is clear that if there is no <em>potential </em>for coverage and, hence, no duty to defend under the terms of the policy, there can be no action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the covenant is based on the contractual relationship between the insured and the insurer. <em>(Love </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1151-1153.) As the <em>Love </em>court observed, its \u201cconclusion that a bad faith claim cannot be maintained unless policy benefits are due is in accord with the policy in which the duty of good faith is [firmly] rooted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1153.) The legal principle is based on general contract law and the long-standing rule \u201c \u2018that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gruenberg </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 566, 573 [108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032], citing <em>Communale </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 654, 658 [328 P.2d 198]; see also <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 818.) In sum, the covenant is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party\u2019s rights to the benefits of the agreement. <em>(Love, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1153.) Thus, as the <em>Love </em>court noted, when benefits are due an insured, \u201cdelayed payment based on inadequate or tardy investigations, oppressive conduct by claims adjusters seeking to reduce the amounts legitimately payable and numerous other tactics may breach the implied covenant because\u201d they frustrate the insured\u2019s right to receive the benefits of the contract in \u201cprompt compensation for losses.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Absent that contractual right, however, the implied covenant has nothing upon which to act as a supplement, and \u201cshould not be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">When evaluating an insurer\u2019s alleged violation of Insurance Code section 790.03, we are guided by the principles of first party coverage, and the fact that the insurer owes its insured an independent duty to process all claims submitted to it in a reasonable manner, and not to delay, to the insured\u2019s prejudice, the ultimate decision to defend or indemnify. For example, where an insurer undertakes a defense under a reservation of rights, and then fails to pursue the defense in a reasonable manner, the insurer may be subject to penalties under section 790.03. (See, e.g., <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lesher </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 169, 190 [231 Cal.Rptr. 791] [insurer must process all claims submitted to it competently even when no coverage will be provided].) Thus, our holding does not foreclose the insurance commissioner from imposing administrative sanctions against an insurance company responsible for committing unfair practices that are independent of the insurance contract and proscribed by section 790.03. <em>(Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In the present case, however, we cannot say that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding neither T.I.E. nor Farmers violated Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Code section 790.03. There is no indication that either defendant unnecessarily delayed performing its investigative duties under the policy or misled plaintiffs into believing it would provide either a defense or coverage to the Amey complaint, and any finding to the contrary would misconstrue the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">If an insurance policy provides no potential basis for coverage, the insurer is under no duty to defend an action against the insured. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) We conclude T.I.E.\u2019s CGL policy provided no potential for coverage in a suit based on business and economic torts. Because T.I.E. was under no obligation to defend or indemnify the Amey action, it did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In addition, T.I.E.\u2019s denial of a defense did not independently violate Insurance Code section 790.03. The same holding applies to Farmers, as T.LE.\u2019s adjuster. We therefore conclude the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Mosk, J., Arabian, J., Baxter, J., George, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AU-\">Insurance policies are, first and last, contracts. This court has repeatedly emphasized that by and large an insurance policy is interpreted no differently than any other contract, and that when the parties express their intent in unambiguous language in the policy, that intent governs. Although courts have evolved special rules for interpreting ambiguities in insurance policies, what these rules have in common is that they protect the insured. No special rules have developed that deny an insured coverage that an insurer has promised in unambiguous policy language.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Because the Court of Appeal believed that CGL policies were never intended to cover conduct that causes economic losses, it did not address (except for brief reference in a footnote) either the \u201cnamed insured\u201d or \u201cemployee liability\u201d exclusions that may have provided additional grounds for denying a duty to defend the Amey action. We find it unnecessary to address alternative grounds for denying a duty to defend in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>",

Rather than hewing to the language of the insurance policy at issue in this case, the majority concludes that coverage within the ordinary and unambiguous meaning of the policy language does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Specifically, the majority holds that the liability insurance policy issued by defendant insurers excludes coverage for bodily injuries related to economic (i.e., intangible property) losses. The majority errs in doing so, for its conclusion finds no support in the language of the policy or in any other evidence of the mutual intent of defendant insurers and plaintiff insureds. The plain language of the policy covers liability for all bodily injuries caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as any \u201cevent, or series of events . . . proximately caused by an act or omission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>insured . . . which results ... in bodily injury . . . neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Nothing in the ordinary meaning of this language, and nothing in the rest of the policy, excludes coverage for bodily injuries resulting from events that either themselves are economic losses or cause economic losses in addition to bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Because the majority\u2019s approach has no support in our law or in the language of the contract at issue here, I disagree with the majority\u2019s reasoning. As I shall explain, however, I would nonetheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal because there is an independent reason why defendant insurers properly denied coverage here: Plaintiff insureds sought coverage under the bodily injury coverage of the insurance policy for a lawsuit alleging they had intentionally caused someone to suffer emotional and physical distress; the insurance policy excludes coverage for bodily injuries expected or intended by the insureds, such as the intentional injuries alleged against the insureds; thus, there was no coverage under the policy for the lawsuit against plaintiff insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Waller owned 60 percent of Marmac, Inc. (Marmac) and was its president; Amey owned 40 percent and was its vice-president. Waller sold his stock to Marmac employees Akers, Hendrix, He.pple, and Petersen (referred to hereafter collectively with Waller and Marmac as the insureds), who thereafter demoted and ultimately terminated Amey.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Amey sued the insureds. Amey alleged 12 causes of action in his amended complaint, including, as relevant here, one for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In his cause of action for emotional distress, Amey alleged that he suffered \u201chumiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress\u201d from the \u201cconduct\u201d of the individual insureds alleged in the other causes of action (for example, Waller\u2019s sale of his stock to Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen without notice to Amey and allegedly in breach of a contract to sell the stock to Amey; the alleged interference by Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen with Amey\u2019s contract with Waller for the sale of Waller\u2019s stock; Amey\u2019s demotion and subsequent termination in breach of his employment contract with Marmac; Akers, Hendrix, Hepple, and Petersen\u2019s bad faith abuse of their positions as controlling shareholders and directors to engage in self-dealing and to deny Amey a voice in corporate affairs). Amey alleged that the individual insureds\u2019 conduct had been \u201cintentional and malicious and . . . done for the purpose of causing Amey . . . emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and physical distress.\u201d At his deposition, Amey testified he had suffered headaches, back pains, and rashes as a result of the individual insureds\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The insureds were insured under a policy issued by Truck Insurance Exchange through Farmers Insurance Exchange (collectively Truck). The insureds tendered their defense to Truck, which rejected it on the ground that Amey\u2019s causes of action were not covered under the policy. The insureds sued Truck for bad faith denial of its duty to defend, contending that Amey\u2019s cause of action for emotional distress was covered under the Truck policy. The insureds also alleged that Truck had breached its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h), which prohibits various acts and practices by insurers in processing and settling the claims of their insureds. In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court held that Amey\u2019s cause of action for emotional distress was covered under the policy and, accordingly, Truck had a duty to defend; a jury then determined that Truck had also breached its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the Truck policy did not cover bodily injury related to economic loss, and holding that there could be no cause of action under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h) because there was no coverage under the Truck policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Whether Truck had a duty to defend turns on whether the relevant facts or pleadings give rise to any potential for coverage under the policy. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 277 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].) The insureds contend that there was the potential for coverage under the policy of Amey\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. I conclude that there was no potential for coverage because Amey\u2019s cause of action fell within the policy\u2019s exclusion of injuries expected or intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">In <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 37 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048], this court recently summarized the principles governing the interpretation of insurance contracts: \u201c \u2018While insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; <em>see AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 821-822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].) \u2018The fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the parties. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.)\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1264.) \u2018Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. \u2019 <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) \u2018If contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638.)\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1264.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Application of these principles yields a straightforward resolution of this case. No party has put forward extrinsic evidence bearing on the interpretation of the policy. Therefore, it is solely the language of the policy that determines whether coverage exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The coverage clause of the policy obligates the insurer to \u201cpay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of [cf0 (C) <em>bodily injury </em>to any person . . . [H . . . P3D \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [H \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <em>caused by an occurrence.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The question of coverage therefore turns on whether there was \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Did Amey allege a \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy? The policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness, or disease.\u201d Amey alleged in his complaint that he had suffered both emotional and physical distress as a result of the insureds\u2019 conduct. At his deposition, Amey testified that the insureds\u2019 conduct had caused him to suffer headaches, back pains, and rashes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Most of the courts that have addressed the issue have held that any physical manifestations accompanying emotional distress are \u201cbodily injuries\u201d as that term is used in insurance policies. <em>(Aim Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Culcasi </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 209, 220, 226 [280 Cal.Rptr. 766]; <em>Employers Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Foust </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 382, 387 [105 Cal.Rptr. 505]; <em>Garvis </em>v. <em>Employers Mut. Cas.

On its face, the policy\u2019s definitional language, \u201cbodily injury, sickness, or disease,\u201d broadly covers any somatic condition, and does not exclude those that are caused or accompanied by mental distress. Although I therefore assume for purposes of this case that at least the physical symptoms Amey alleged he suffered were \u201cbodily injuries\u201d within the meaning of the policy, it is not necessary to decide the issue because I conclude, for the reasons discussed below, that there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d within the policy\u2019s definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Were Amey\u2019s \u201cbodily injuries\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d? The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean \u201can <em>event, </em>or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, <em>proximately caused by </em>an act or omission of <em>the insured </em>regardless of the number of persons, vehicles or objects affected by such act or omission <em>which results, </em>during the policy period, in <em>bodily injury </em>or property damage, <em>neither expected nor intended </em>from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d (Italics added.) Stated otherwise, the elements of an \u201coccurrence\u201d can be broken down into (1) an event or series of events (2) proximately caused by the insured (3) resulting in bodily injury or property damage, (4) with the injury or damage being neither expected nor intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The majority and I agree on the elements of the \u201coccurrence\u201d definition. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 20 [\u201cto demonstrate a potential for coverage under [Truck\u2019s] policy, an insured must show the claim he must defend is an alleged act or omission that caused bodily injury or tangible property damage (as defined by the policy) to the third party, and that the alleged injury was neither expected nor intended by the insured\u201d].) The majority, however, never applies these elements to the facts of this case to determine whether there was a potential for coverage of Amey\u2019s claims against the insureds. Accordingly, I do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The first element of the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d requires an \u201cevent, or series of events.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conduct of plaintiffs that Amey alleged caused his injury (e.g., his demotion, the sale of stock from Waller to the other four plaintiffs) certainly was a series of events in the ordinary meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The second element of \u201coccurrence\u201d requires that the insured proximately cause the event or events. There is no dispute that the events alleged by Amey to have caused his injury were ones that he alleged the individual insureds had proximately caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The third element of \u201coccurrence\u201d requires, as relevant here, that the events result in bodily injury. As I have already explained, to the extent Amey suffered physical manifestations of his emotional distress, I assume the events resulted in bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The fourth element of the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d requires that the bodily injury be \u201cneither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d It is on this point that the insureds\u2019 claim for coverage fails. The intentional infliction of emotional distress that Amey alleged is not an occurrence within the policy\u2019s definition because the tort requires that the insured either intend or expect that the emotional distress (and any accompanying physical manifestations) occur. \u201cThe tort calls for intentional, or at least reckless conduct\u2014conduct intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.\u201d <em>(Davidson </em>v. <em>City of Westminster </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 210 [185 Cal.Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894].) To state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege \u201cthat the conduct of . . . the defendants was directed primarily at them, was calculated to cause them severe emotional distress, or was done with knowledge of their presence and of a substantial certainty that they would suffer severe emotional injury.\u201d <em>(Christensen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 906 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 79, 820 P.2d 181].)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Any injury caused by the insured that is calculated (i.e., intended), or which the insured knew was substantially certain to result from the insured\u2019s conduct, however, is an injury that the insured \u201cexpected or intended.\u201d <em>(Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 745-748 [insured \u201cexpected or intended\u201d a result if the insured intended the result or believed the result was substantially certain or highly likely to occur].) Because the intentional infliction of emotional distress is an injury that is either \u201ccalculated\u201d by the insured or that the insured knew was \u201csubstantially] certain[]\u201d to result <em>(Christensen </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 906), policy language that, as here, excludes from coverage acts that the insured \u201cexpected or intended\u201d thereby excludes coverage of any cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>In this case, Amey specifically alleged that the insureds\u2019 acts were intended to cause him both emotional and physical injury. Both Amey\u2019s original complaint and his amended complaint alleged that the conduct of the insureds \u201cwas intentional and malicious and was done for the purpose of causing Amey to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d The definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the Truck policy excludes events resulting in injuries that the insured expects or intends. (See <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 745-748.) Therefore, Amey\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress cannot be a covered occurrence because it alleged that the insureds intended the emotional and physical injuries that they caused him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Accord, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. </em>(1985) 127 Wis.2d 298, 302-304 [380 N.W.2d 372, 374-375].) Because there was no potential for coverage under the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d for the emotional and physical distress the insureds allegedly intentionally caused to Amey, Truck properly denied the insureds\u2019 tender of their defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The majority, however, ignores the controlling language of the policy that I have just discussed. Instead, the majority manufactures an exclusion of bodily injuries \u201crelated to\u201d economic losses that has no basis in the policy language or in any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intent, and on that ground concludes there was no potential for coverage of Amey\u2019s lawsuit against the insureds. The majority asserts that because the events underlying Amey\u2019s lawsuit caused uncovered \u201ceconomic\u201d (i.e., intangible property) losses to Amey, there can be no coverage for any bodily injuries to Amey that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>caused by, or even related to, the same events. Under the majority\u2019s view, there is no coverage for bodily injuries that are in any way related to economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">On what basis does the majority reach this conclusion? Instead of closely analyzing the policy language to determine whether coverage exists, the majority engages in a lengthy recitation of three cases on which the Court of Appeal relied, and then in a conclusory paragraph asserts that \u201cCGL policies do not provide coverage for economic losses that cause emotional distress. . . . These policies were never intended to cover emotional distress damages that flow from an uncovered \u2018occurrence,\u2019 ...\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 23.) Accordingly, the majority concludes that there was no potential for coverage because \u201c[a] 11 allegations in the Amey complaint were related to Amey\u2019s asserted <em>economic loss </em>as a Marmac shareholder.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is wrong. The majority\u2019s exclusion of all bodily injuries \u201crelated to\u201d an economic loss is an unsupportable judicial rewriting of the insurance contract at issue here. The majority does not and cannot justify its sweeping statements by anything found in the language of the policy. Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, nothing in the language of the insureds\u2019 policy with Truck excludes coverage for bodily injuries that are \u201crelated to\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 23) economic losses. The Truck policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d does not exclude injuries that are caused by or related to economic losses. It covers all \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease,\u201d regardless of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Likewise, the Truck policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d broadly encompasses any \u201cevent, or series of events,\u201d that \u201cresults in . . . bodily injury,\u201d whether or not one of the events in the chain of causation also causes a concurrent economic loss or is itself an economic loss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d nowhere excludes from that term events that either are economic losses or are \u201crelated to\u201d economic losses. The ordinary meaning of \u201cevent\u201d is \u201csomething that happens.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Diet. (9th ed. 1988) p. 430.) An economic loss is \u201csomething that happens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Thus, there is nothing in the policy language that limits \u201coccurrence,\u201d as the majority does, to \u201can event based on a noneconomic act\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26). Rather, as I set forth earlier, the policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d to include events that result in bodily injury. An occurrence does not become a nonoccurrence simply because the event causes both bodily injury and economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The majority\u2019s erroneous conclusion arises from its mistaken view that the bodily injury and property damage coverages of the Truck policy are somehow interdependent, and that therefore \u201cthe occurrence or act leading to coverage must be an injury to tangible property, not to one\u2019s economic interest.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26.) The majority\u2019s conclusion is contrary to the express policy language at issue in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The coverage clause of the policy obligates the insurer to \u201cpay all damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of [&lt;]0 (C) <em>bodily injury </em>to any person, and [U . . . [U (E) damage to property . . . [1 to which this insurance applies, <em>caused by an </em>occurrence.\u201d (Italics added.) The bodily injury coverage (which the policy refers to as \u201cCoverage C\u201d) is independent of the property damage coverage (which the policy refers to as \u201cCoverage E\u201d). Coverage E and coverage C, for example, are subject to different exclusions, can be separately purchased, and can be subject to different liability limits. The coverage clause does not require that for a bodily injury to be covered under coverage C it must be caused by property damage covered under coverage E. Likewise, under the policy\u2019s definition of occurrence, it is irrelevant whether the event resulting in bodily injury under coverage C takes the form of property loss that is not covered under coverage E; all that is necessary is that the event, whatever its nature, \u201cresult[] in . . . bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The majority is therefore wrong in its assertion that coverage for bodily injury under coverage C is limited to events that also cause property damage that is covered under coverage E. (\u201c[T]he occurrence or act leading to coverage [for bodily injury under coverage C] must be an injury to tangible property [i.e., property damage covered under coverage E], not to one\u2019s economic interest.\u201d Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26.) The Truck policy independently covers either property damage <em>or </em>bodily injury resulting from an event or series of events proximately caused by an insured, regardless of the nature of the intermediate events in the chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The majority maintains nonetheless that it was the \u201cintent of the parties\u201d to exclude from coverage bodily injuries related to economic losses. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 28.) But the majority offers no evidence that the parties here mutually held this supposed intent. What the majority calls the \u201cintent\u201d of the parties is actually its own opinion of how insurance policies should be drafted. It is not this court\u2019s function, however, to draft or redraft insurance policies. The true intent of the parties in this case is the meaning to be found in the language of the policy\u2014nothing more, nothing less. As the analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>above reveals, the policy language reflects no intent to exclude all bodily injuries related to economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Nor are the three cases relied on by the majority and by the Court of Appeal persuasive. Like the majority, those decisions failed to ground their conclusions in the contractual language before them. In the first of those cases, <em>Chatton </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 846, 857 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 318], defrauded investors sought to recover from the insurer of a corporation\u2019s directors and officers for the emotional distress (without any physical symptoms) caused by \u201cthe loss of their investment.\u201d The Court of Appeal in <em>Chatton </em>concluded that emotional distress without accompanying physical manifestations is not \u201cbodily injury\u201d for purposes of a policy containing the same \u201cbodily injury\u201d definition that is at issue here. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 853-857.) Although this holding was dispositive of the case, since the shareholders had not claimed any physical symptoms, the court went on to conclude that the wrongful acts also were not accidental and therefore were not \u201coccurrences\u201d under a policy definition that, unlike the policy in this case, required that occurrences be accidents, not merely events. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 860-862.) Finally, <em>Chatton </em>held that when a policy provides coverage for bodily injury <em>or </em>tangible property damage, there is no coverage for bodily injuries caused by intangible property loss. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 857-860.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The Court of Appeal in <em>Chatton </em>based its conclusion that the policy before it excluded coverage for bodily injuries caused by intangible property loss on its assertion that \u201cthe \u2018bodily injury\u2019 clause of the CGL policy . . . incorporated coverage for loss or destruction of tangible property as well.\u201d <em>(Chatton </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 860.) The court, however, did not explain how the bodily injury coverage \u201cincorporated\u201d the property damage coverage, nor could it have done so, for in <em>Chatton, </em>as here, the two forms of coverage were independent. Like the majority, the <em>Chatton </em>court erroneously collapsed the two forms of coverage together. <em>Chatton </em>failed to recognize that any bodily injuries, whatever their cause, were independently covered under the bodily injury coverage, and it viewed bodily injury caused by economic loss only as a form of consequential damages accompanying an uncovered intangible property loss. The two cases that follow <em>Chatton, </em>and on which the majority also relies, <em>Keating </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 154, 156-157, and <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1150-1151 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 559], adopt Chatton's faulty analysis without adding anything to it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In addition to being contrary to the language of the Truck policy, the majority\u2019s adoption of Chatton's approach is at odds with this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>decision in <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1084 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792], <em>Horace Mann </em>rejected the notion that the existence of a duty to defend turns on whether there is coverage for the \u201cdominant factor\u201d of the lawsuit. Rather, in determining the duty to defend, \u201c[w]e look not to whether noncovered acts predominate in the third party\u2019s action, but rather to whether there is <em>any </em>potential for liability under the policy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.., </em>original italics.) <em>Horace Mann </em>thus precludes the majority\u2019s approach of excluding covered losses simply because they are \u201crelated to\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 30) uncovered losses that are the dominant factor in the lawsuit against the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Even if the decisions in <em>Chatton </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846, <em>Keating </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins., supra, </em>995 F.2d 154, and <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1132, were correct, they would be inapplicable on the facts of this case. The injured parties in the three cases just cited were defrauded investors who were emotionally distressed because they had lost money, not because of the content of the fraudulent statements or the other conduct by the insureds that caused them to lose money. Unlike the injured investors in those cases, however, Amey did not allege that his emotional and physical distress arose from the financial loss caused by the insureds. Rather, he alleged that his emotional and physical distress arose from his demotion and termination, his loss of influence and control over Marmac, and other \u201cconduct\u201d by the insureds\u2014conduct that <em>in addition </em>caused him financial loss. Intangible economic loss was not the cause, only an accompaniment, of Amey\u2019s emotional and physical distress. Amey\u2019s distress and his economic loss were concurrent effects of the insureds\u2019 conduct, not successive effects as was the case in <em>Chatton. </em>Thus, here Amey\u2019s emotional and physical distress was independent of his economic loss in a way that was not true in Chatton,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Nor can the majority\u2019s holding be justified by its assertion that the exclusion of bodily injury related to economic loss conforms to the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of the insureds. The reasonable expectations doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>comes into play only when the language of an insurance policy relevant to a particular question of coverage is ambiguous. <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 37; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].) As there is no ambiguous policy language to construe here, there is no basis for applying the reasonable expectations doctrine in this case. Even if there were some basis for applying it here, the doctrine requires a court to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured by extending coverage to the insured. <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 37; <em>ALU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].) This court has never deployed the reasonable expectations doctrine as the majority does here to <em>deny </em>an insured coverage that is within the ordinary and unambiguous meaning of the policy language, and it is a misuse of the doctrine to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The majority creates a blanket rule that no coverage exists under the bodily injury liability provisions of an insurance policy if the bodily injury is related to property damage not covered by the policy. That rule will restrict the bodily injury coverage provided by any policy that, like the Truck policy here, on its face covers bodily injury independent of whether or not any related property damage is covered by the policy. For example, assume a policy that provides coverage for bodily injuries, but not property damage, caused by the insured. The majority\u2019s reasoning would deny an insured coverage for any bodily injury caused by property damage (e.g., if the insured\u2019s car strikes and damages a tree that falls and injures someone) solely because there is no coverage for the property damage that is the immediate cause of the bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The ordinary meaning of the pertinent Truck policy language covers bodily injuries without regard for the nature of the event causing the bodily injury. The policy therefore covers bodily injuries that are caused by economic losses or, as here, are caused by an event that also causes an economic loss. Had Truck wanted to exclude coverage for bodily injuries related to economic loss, it could, as the drafter of the policy at issue in this case, have so provided. It is not the proper role of this court to manufacture coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>exclusions that are contrary to the express language of the policy, as the majority does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">As I have previously explained, however, Amey\u2019s complaint did not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the Truck policy for a far different reason. The policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an event resulting in bodily injury <em>neither expected nor intended </em>by the insured. Amey alleged that the emotional and physical distress that he suffered was intended by the insureds. Because he alleged that the insureds intended to cause him those injuries, those injuries were not caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the policy\u2019s definition of that term. It is on that ground that I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied October 26, 1995, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The insureds renewed their tender of defense on the basis of Amey\u2019s deposition testimony; Truck never responded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The requirement of an \u201cevent\u201d that causes injury is a departure in Truck\u2019s policy from the language of the current standard commercial general liability (CGL) policy drafted by the Insurance Services Office (an insurance industry trade group). The standard CGL policy requires that an \u201caccident,\u201d not an \u201cevent,\u201d cause the injury. (Insurance Services Office, Commercial General Liability Coverage Form (eff. Jan. 1, 1986), reprinted in 3 Cal. Insurance Law and Practice (1995) Business General Liability Policies, appen. C.) The Truck policy represents a broadening of coverage in that the cause of injury no longer need be sudden and fortuitous, as it must be under an \u201caccident\u201d occurrence clause. (Compare <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1560, 1565 [281 Cal.Rptr. 375] [\u201cthe word \u2018event\u2019 is not limited to fortuitous happenings\u201d] with <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 751 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] [discussing \u201caccident\u201d occurrence clause\u2019s requirements of suddenness and fortuity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In this respect, the majority is mistaken in describing the Truck policy as a \u201cstandard\u201d CGL policy. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 19.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The insureds do not contend that, although Amey\u2019s complaint was limited to the intentional infliction of emotional distress, he might have ultimately recovered damages for emotional and physical distress on a theory that those injuries were negligently inflicted and that therefore there was a potential for coverage. (See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Truck denied coverage to the insureds on the ground that \u201cIntentional Acts are not covered . . . .\u201d Although inartfully phrased (because it focuses on intentional acts rather than intentional damage or injury), it seems clear that the purpose of Truck\u2019s letter was to invoke the \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d language of the \u201coccurrence\u201d definition. Because I conclude that there was no potential for coverage for the same reason, I find it unnecessary to address the waiver and estoppel arguments addressed in section C of the majority opinion. Likewise, I do not have occasion to address the retroactivity and legal uncertainty issues considered by the majority. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 24-26.) Nor is it necessary for me to address the other alternative grounds for denying coverage put forward by Truck. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 20, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">I concur in the majority\u2019s decision that in the absence of any potential for coverage the insureds do not have a cause of action against Truck for its alleged violation of its duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h) with respect to its processing and resolution of the insureds\u2019 claim for coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">In this part, I put aside for the moment the \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d portion of the Truck policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d that I discussed previously in part II, as the majority does not base its exclusion of bodily injuries related to economic losses on that language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is also contrary to its acknowledgment elsewhere that \u201cthe CGL policy provides coverage for \u2018occurrences\u2019 that cause bodily injury <em>or </em>tangible property losses.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 23, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Nor does <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Interbank Financial Services </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 825 [264 Cal.Rptr. 25] support the majority\u2019s holding. <em>Allstate </em>involved a policy with language quite different from either the Truck policy at issue in this case or the standard CGL policy. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Allstate </em>the insureds were sued for economic losses (but not emotional or physical injuries) allegedly caused by erroneous and fraudulent investment advice they had provided. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 827-828.) The policy in <em>Allstate </em>excluded coverage for damages \u201c \u2018arising out of the rendering of or the failure to render . . . professional services, or consulting business . . . services.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 829.) The court held that under this exclusion there was no coverage under the policy for the lawsuit against the insureds; \u201cthe clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 831.) That the quite different policy language in <em>Allstate </em>did not cover economic losses caused by the investment advice given by the insureds in that case says nothing about whether the Truck policy covers the insureds for the bodily injury they allegedly caused to Amey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\">Moreover, Amey claimed the insureds caused him emotional and physical distress by conduct that did not cause any accompanying economic loss. Amey testified at his deposition in his lawsuit against the insureds that the insureds had humiliated him by cutting his office telephone lines, packing his belongings and putting them out on the sidewalk, and humiliating him in front of a client. None of these acts caused economic loss to Amey. As I have noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>previously, the insureds renewed their tender of defense on the basis of Amey\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">This case presents other distinctions as well from <em>Chatton </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846. Unlike <em>Chatton, </em>here there was physical injury accompanying the emotional distress. Also unlike <em>Chatton, </em>here the Truck policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d in terms of events, not accidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>",

Aetna and West American refused the tender of defense of the underlying complaint. General Accident not only accepted the tender from its insured, but agreed to defend the insureds of Aetna and West American under an assignment of their rights against their insurers; it also contributed to the settlement on behalf of the insureds of all three carriers. Summary judgment on the declaratory relief action was granted in favor of Aetna and West American, and General Accident appeals on the duty to defend issue only. We find a duty to defend as a matter of law and reverse.</p>\n<p>On April 11, 1989, Donald Owens filed a complaint for damages against, among others, Sportsman Associates, Inc. (SAI), Hall &amp; Powell Insurance Services, Inc. (H&amp;P), and Sportsman, Hall and Powell, Inc. (SHP).<sup>[1]</sup> Owens alleged that in 1983, he was president and part owner of an insurance agency known as the Escondido agency. In November of that year, he sold the agency to Glenfed Insurance Services and stayed on as its manager. In April 1988, Owens was approached by certain of the underlying defendants with a proposal that he join with H&amp;P and SAI in an insurance business venture. Owens and the defendants agreed: (1) Owens would repurchase the Escondido agency from Glenfed; (2) a new corporation, SHP, would be formed to acquire and operate the agency, and the owners of SHP would be Owens, SAI and H&amp;P; and (3) Owens would serve SHP as its president and be employed by it as the manager of the Escondido agency.</p>\n<p>In June 1988, Owens purchased the Escondido agency with a down payment of $44,000 provided by defendant Murray Sportsman and signed a promissory note for the balance of the purchase price, $220,000. Among the assets Owens received in the purchase was Glenfed's lease of the premises occupied by the agency. Thereafter, Owens operated the agency as its manager.</p>\n<p>In November 1988, SHP had its first formal meeting at which Owens was elected president, and shares of common stock were issued in the amounts of 325 shares to SAI, 325 to H&amp;P, and 70 to Owens. Contrary to their previous representations, however, SAI and H&amp;P failed to cause SHP to acquire the assets of the agency or to assume the lease from Owens.</p>\n<p>On January 20, 1989, Owens was summarily terminated as manager of the agency and as president of SHP. After that date, the underlying defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> \"privately, for their own benefit and refusing to allow the participation of Owens, operated the Escondido agency in the following manner: [\u00b6] (a) Occupying the premises leased to Owens; [\u00b6] (b) Employing the files and records of the Escondido agency purchased from Glenfed and owned by Owens; [\u00b6] (c) Contacting the agency's clients and advising the insureds that [SHP was] the owner[] of the agency and that Owens was no longer associated with the business; and [\u00b6] (d) Receiving the income from the agency and disbursing the same as funds owned by said defendants.\"</p>\n<p>Based on these allegations, Owens stated the following causes of action against the defendants: wrongful termination, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, interference with contractual relations and interference with prospective economic advantage. Regarding the continued operation of the Escondido agency by the defendants, Owens sought the remedies of constructive trust, accounting, appointment of a receiver and injunctive relief. He also sought the involuntary dissolution of SHP and the cancellation of its stock issuance.</p>\n<p>Under the cause of action for interference with contractual relations, Owens alleged the defendants disrupted his relationship with Glenfed by \"causing [his] performance in respect of the contract with Glenfed to be impossible or, at least, impracticable for the reason that [he] has been ousted from the Escondido agency by said defendants, denied all the benefits of the insurance business purchased from Glenfed and manipulated by defendants into a position which prevents [him] from paying the purchase price owed to Glenfed.\" The allegation of ouster was repeated under the cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage. Under the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Owens alleged he had been \"callously ejected from the Escondido agency....\"</p>\n<p>SHP was insured by West American during the relevant time period under a business owners policy. The coverage clause of the comprehensive business liability part states: \"The Company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, property damage or personal injury caused by an occurrence to which this insurance applies.\" (Italics omitted.) The term \"occurrence\" is defined as \"with respect to personal injury, the commission of an offense, or a series of similar or related offenses....\" \"Personal injury\" is defined as \"injury which arises out of one or more of the following offenses committed in the conduct of the named insured's business: [\u00b6] ... <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> (c) wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy....\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>H&amp;P was insured by Aetna under its office insurance program. The coverage clause of the personal and advertising injury liability section of its commercial general liability coverage states: \"We will pay those sums that the `insured' becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of `personal injury' or `advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.... [\u00b6] (2) This insurance applies to `personal injury' only if caused by an offense: ... [\u00b6] Arising out of the conduct of your business....\" The Aetna policy defined \"personal injury\" as \"injury, other than `bodily injury', arising out of one or more of the following offenses: [\u00b6] (c) Wrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies....\"</p>\n<p>General Accident accepted SAI's tender for defense of the Owens complaint. When West American and Aetna declined the tenders from SHP and H&amp;P, General Accident funded the defense for them after receiving an assignment of their rights against their insurers. The action was settled and Owens received $160,000, of which General Accident contributed $25,000. General Accident expended over $118,000 in the defense of all defendants.</p>\n<p>General Accident filed its complaint for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial determination of the obligations of West American and Aetna for the defense and indemnification of the defendants in the Owens action. Both West American and Aetna filed motions for summary judgment on the grounds that their respective policies did not provide coverage for the underlying loss and there was no duty to defend. General Accident filed a motion for summary judgment, heard on the same day, seeking an adjudication that each insurer had a duty to defend its insured. The trial court found, as a matter of law, that there was no potential for liability under either policy and granted summary judgment for West American and Aetna. General Accident's motion for summary judgment was denied.</p>\n<p>On appeal, General Accident contends the allegations that Owens had been \"ousted\" and \"ejected\" from the premises leased to him created the potential for coverage under both policy definitions of personal injury: \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" and \"wrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies....\" As discussed below, we conclude this contention is correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> 1. <i>General Principles Applicable to the Duty to Defend</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(1) The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed the long-standing principles applicable to an insurer's duty to defend. \"It is by now a familiar principle that a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.... [T]he duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] Any doubt as to whether the facts give rise to a duty to defend is resolved in the insured's favor.\" (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>, 1081 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal. Rptr.2d 210</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">846 P.2d 792</span>].) \"The insured's desire to secure the right to call on the insurer's superior resources for the defense of third party claims is, in all likelihood, typically as significant a motive for the purchase of insurance as is the wish to obtain indemnity for possible liability. As a consequence, California courts have been consistently solicitous of insureds' expectations on this score. [Citations.]\" (<i>Montrose Chemical Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158094/montrose-chemical-corp-v-superior-court/\">6 Cal.4th 287</a></span>, 295-296 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. Rptr.2d 467</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">861 P.2d 1153</span>] (<i>Montrose I</i>).)<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>(2) In <i>Montrose I,</i> the Supreme Court reiterated that the insured need only show the bare possibility of coverage to trigger a defense duty. (<i>Montrose I, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">supra,</a></span></i> 6 Cal.4th at p. 300.) To prevail in an action seeking declaratory relief on the issue of the duty to defend, \"... the insured must prove the existence of a <i>potential for coverage,</i> while the insurer must establish <i>the absence of any such potential.</i> In other words, the insured need only show that the underlying claim <i>may</i> fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it <i>cannot.</i>\" (<i>Ibid.</i> at p. 300.)</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court also discussed the timing and duration of the duty to defend. \"The defense duty is a continuing one, arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded [citation], or until it has been shown that there is <i>no</i> potential for coverage.... Imposition of an immediate duty to defend is necessary to afford the insured what it is entitled to: the full protection of a defense on its behalf. [Citation.]\" (6 Cal.4th at p. 295.) The determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend rests on the allegations of the complaint and extrinsic facts known to the insurer at the time of tender. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 296-299.) \"Once the defense duty attaches, the insurer is obligated to defend against all of the claims involved in the action, both covered and noncovered, until the insurer produces undeniable evidence supporting an allocation of a specific portion of the defense costs to a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> noncovered claim. [Citations.]\" (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">supra,</a></span></i> 4 Cal.4th at p. 1081.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>General Principles Applicable to Personal Injury Liability Coverage</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(3) Unlike liability coverage for property damage or bodily injury, personal injury coverage is not based on an accidental occurrence. Rather, it is triggered by one of the offenses listed in the policy. \"In the world of liability insurance, personal injury coverage applies to injury which arises out of the commission of certain enumerated acts or offenses. [Citations.] Coverage thus is triggered by the offense, not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers.\" (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal. App.4th 492</span>, 511 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">20 Cal. Rptr.2d 376</span>].) \"[T]he term personal [in personal injury] is used in a highly specialized sense. It does not mean physical damage to a person; rather it means injury arising out of one or more specified offenses.\" (3 Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice. (1988 rev.) \u00a7 49.403, p. 49-69.)</p>\n<p>Personal injury coverage, intended to broaden coverage from the confines of bodily injury or property damage, has been applied to a wide variety of claims. (Pasich, <i>Advertising Injury and Personal Injury Coverage,</i> in 2 Ostrager &amp; Newman, 11th Annual Insurance, Excess, and Reinsurance Coverage Disputes (Practicing Law Institute (Jan./Feb. 1994) p. 309).) \"To the extent the listed offenses [in the policy] are framed in generic terms, they should be construed broadly to encompass all specific torts which reasonably could fall within the general category.\" (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., supra,</i> 16 Cal. App.4th at p. 515.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>West American's Policy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(4a) West American's policy language, which is identical to that of General Accident's, provides coverage for injury arising out of \"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" committed in the conduct of the insured's business. This phrase, adopted by the insurance industry as part of the standard broad form comprehensive general liability endorsement, has been construed as applying to tort claims arising out of the interference with an interest in real property. (<i>Fragomeno</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of the West</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">207 Cal. App.3d 822</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">255 Cal. Rptr. 111</span>]; <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Great American Ins. Companies</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. App.3d 766</span>, 775-776 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. Rptr. 416</span>].) These claims have included physical invasions of property, such as trespass and nuisance (see, e.g., <i>Martin Marietta Corp.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">40 Cal. App.4th 1113</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">47 Cal. Rptr.2d 670</span>]; <i>Hartford Accident and Indemnity</i> v. <i>Krekeler</i> (8th Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> 1974) <span class=\"citation no-link\">491 F.2d 884</span>) and noninvasive interferences with the use and enjoyment of property (<i>American States Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Canyon Creek</i> (N.D.Cal. 1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">786 F. Supp. 821</span> [misrepresentation regarding purchasers' rights to ownership of real property underlying mobilehomes]; <i>Town of Goshen</i> v. <i>Grange Mut. Ins. Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534423\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534423/town-of-goshen-v-grange-mut-ins-co/\">120 N.H. 915</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">424 A.2d 822</span>] [wrongful delay by city in subdivision approval]).</p>\n<p>Here, Owens alleged his right to possession of the agency premises under the assignment of the lease when he purchased the agency from Glenfed. He alleged the defendants interfered with that right by ousting and ejecting him from the premises. These allegations clearly constitute an invasion of an interest in real property and raise the potential for coverage under West American's policy.</p>\n<p>West American points to information discovered through interrogatories and depositions that suggests Glenfed did not assign the lease to Owens. But these facts were discovered well into 1990; West American declined its insured's tender of defense in September 1989. (5) The duty to defend is based on information available at the time of tender and cannot be adjudged on hindsight. (<i>Montrose I, supra,</i> 6 Cal.4th at p. 295; <i>Haskel, Inc.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">33 Cal. App.4th 963</span>, 978 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">39 Cal. Rptr.2d 520</span>].) (4b) Furthermore, these facts were not conclusive on the question of the status of the lease; they were disputed by Owens, who also subsequently discovered facts supporting his allegations of ouster. \"[Once] the claims asserted in the underlying action raise a potential for coverage, the insurers have a duty to provide a defense ... upon tender of those claims unless and until they produce in court <i>undisputed</i> extrinsic evidence which <i>conclusively</i> establishes that there is no potential for coverage.\" (<i>Haskel, Inc.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158094/montrose-chemical-corp-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 33 Cal. App.4th at pp. 976-977.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Aetna's Policy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(6) Aetna's policy language provides coverage for personal injury arising out of \"[w]rongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies....\" This is a revised version of the language found in West American's policy and was adopted by the insurance industry in the 1986 standard form comprehensive general liability policy; significantly, it omits the phrase \"`other invasion of the right of private occupancy.'\" (<i>Martin Marietta Corp.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North America, supra,</i> 40 Cal. App.4th at p. 1123.)</p>\n<p>The omission narrows the definition of this particular offense triggering personal injury coverage to a physical invasion of an interest in real property. \"Such language connotes disruptions of the ability of a landowner to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> actually occupy his property....\" (<i>Titan Corp.</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal. App.4th 457</span>, 476 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">27 Cal. Rptr.2d 476</span>].) In <i>American States Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Canyon Creek, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379925\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379925/american-states-ins-co-v-canyon-creek/\">786 F. Supp. 821</a></span>, the court refused to find potential coverage under a policy with the same language for a claim of misrepresentation in the sale of manufactured housing. The insured was covered by two policies issued by American States Insurance Company; both had personal injury coverage, but one had language identical to that of West American's and one identical to Aetna's. Although the court found a duty to defend under the first policy, it distinguished the second: \"This definition clearly refers to some physical act of eviction or entry upon premises, such as trespassing. Nowhere in the underlying actions do plaintiffs allege any such physical invasion of their property.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 829.) The physical invasion need not involve the use or threat of force to dispossess, however. (<i>Fibreboard Corp.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., supra,</i> 16 Cal. App.4th at pp. 511-512.)</p>\n<p>Aetna claims Owens's complaint does not allege a trespass, pointing out that SHP was already on the premises operating the agency when Owens was discharged and that only Owens's employment as manager was terminated. But the complaint alleges that Owens held the lease to the agency in his name and the defendants ousted him and interfered with his right to occupy the premises under the lease. This constitutes a physical invasion of Owens's alleged property right so as to create the potential for coverage and thus the duty to defend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Disposition</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The summary judgments in favor of West American and Aetna are reversed; summary adjudication for General Accident on the issue of duty to defend is granted. Appellant is entitled to costs of appeal.</p>\n<p>Sonenshine, Acting P.J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>A petition for a rehearing was denied February 27, 1996, and respondents' petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 22, 1996.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These defendants were insured, respectively, by General Accident, Aetna, and West American.</p>\n<p>[2]  This policy language is identical to that of General Accident's.</p>\n<p>[3]  A subsequent case, <i>Montrose Chemical Corp.</i> v. <i>Admiral Ins.

Rolstad, San Francisco, for Real Parties in Interest.</p>\n<p>CROSKEY, Acting P.J.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, Continental Casualty Company (Continental), seeks a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order determining that Continental owed a duty to defend a particular lawsuit filed against its insureds, the real parties in interest, Paragon Homes, Inc., and related individuals and entities.<sup>[1]</sup> Continental also seeks an order requiring the trial court to grant Continental's motion for summary judgment on Paragon's complaint against Continental for declaratory relief, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. These claims all arose out of Continental's refusal to provide a defense to Paragon in certain litigation filed in 1994 against Paragon by FN Development Company (Alpha) and related entities.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>As we review this record, it is clear that FN Development was a partner or joint venturer with Paragon in a number of development and construction projects and the FN Development action was brought against Paragon to resolve certain economic disputes then existing, to dissolve their several business relationships and to provide an accounting of their mutual affairs.<sup>[3]</sup> One of the matters of financial dispute was the proper allocation of losses arising from construction defect claims asserted by purchasers of homes in several of the aforesaid development and construction projects. As we explain, the general liability policy issued by Continental did not cover any of the claims made by FN Development and thus Continental had no duty to provide a defense thereto. Therefore, the trial court should have denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*852</span> Paragon's motion for a summary adjudication of Continental's defense duty and, instead, granted Continental's summary judgment motion. We will therefore issue a writ directing the trial court to take such action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</i><sup>[4]</sup></h2>\n<p>Beginning in 1979, FN Development and Paragon entered into a partnership to construct residential and commercial properties. In pursuit of such partnership goals, the parties entered into numerous Development Management Agreements (DMAs) to define and govern their respective rights and liabilities as to particular development projects.</p>\n<p>Although the partnership was, for a time, extremely successful, the ultimate poor performance of some of the development projects caused FN Development to decide to terminate its relationship with Paragon. The performance problems which caused FN Development so much distress arose, at least in part, from a number of construction defect claims made by purchasers of homes in several of the development projects built by the Paragon-FN Development partnership. These claims, many of which were manifested in litigation filed by such purchasers, are hereafter referred to generally as the construction defect claims.</p>\n<p>In July 1994, FN Development sued Paragon seeking declaratory relief, dissolution of their joint ventures and an accounting.<sup>[5]</sup> The complaint explained that the parties had numerous disputes and disagreements over matters that have a material and significant affect on the development, construction, marketing and sale of the development projects.</p>\n<p>The fourth count in the FN Development action was labeled \"declaratory relief-liability for construction defects,\" and alleged that various homeowners that bought Paragon homes built under the DMAs had asserted claims for construction defects. FN Development sought a judicial declaration that Paragon was \"wholly liable for any and all construction defects arising from any of the projects subject to the Paragon DMAs.\"<sup>[6]</sup> It also alleged that Paragon was obligated to contribute $3,225 million to a reserve for <i>future</i> construction defect liabilities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*853</span> Continental had previously issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to Paragon that also insured the Paragon/FN Development partnership<sup>[7]</sup> with an effective period of October 2, 1986 through October 2, 1988.<sup>[8]</sup><i>The defense of the construction defect claims had been tendered to Continental and it had undertaken to defend and settle them.</i> Paragon, however, after being served with the FN Development action, also tendered the defense of that action to Continental on July 3, 1997. Paragon's tender of the defense of the FN Development action was just 27 days before it was scheduled to go to trial.<sup>[9]</sup> Continental ultimately denied coverage on December 17,1997.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Paragon responded by bringing this action against Continental (and a number of its other insurers) for defense and indemnity coverage on July 3, 1998. In its fourth amended complaint (filed in August 2000), Paragon alleged that it was insured under Continental's policy and that Continental had breached that policy by denying coverage for the FN Development action and refusing to provide a defense. Paragon further alleged that a jury trial had been held in the FN Development action in November 1997 and the construction defect claims were litigated in the sixth cause of action for dissolution and accounting, instead of under the fourth count for declaratory relief;<sup>[11]</sup> Paragon had been held <span class=\"star-pagination\">*854</span> liable for 50% of the construction defect losses in the sum of $1,612,500.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Continental moved for summary judgment, arguing that in its action FN Development was not seeking to recover for property damage, but rather was suing to dissolve its multiple business and partnership relationships with Paragon. Further, Continental argued that because the FN Development action sought to apportion profits and losses between business partners under the DMAs, there was no accidental conduct. In short, Continental argued that its policy simply did not provide any potential for coverage for the claims asserted in the FN Development action. Thus, it had no duty to provide Paragon with a defense.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Paragon filed a motion for summary adjudication of Continental's duty to defend the FN Development action.<sup>[13]</sup> Paragon argued that Continental had a duty to provide a defense because (1) FN Development had alleged that Paragon was wholly liable for the construction defect claims; (2) Continental was aware of these claims as it had already accepted their defense on behalf of the Paragon-FN Development partnership; and (3) the FN Development action essentially sought indemnity or contribution for construction defect losses. Therefore, Continental had a duty to defend. Paragon claimed approximately $10 million in defense costs.</p>\n<p>The trial court agreed with Paragon, denied Continental's motion for summary judgment and granted Paragon's motion for summary adjudication.

The FN Development action, at least as is relevant to the coverage issue, seeks to impose the entire liability for all construction defect claims upon Paragon. To the extent that there is coverage for such claims under Continental's policy, Continental is already providing a defense. To the extent that such claims are not covered by liability insurance, then they become partnership obligations which must be shared or allocated between the partners as provided in their several partnership agreements or under relevant principles of law. That, however, is not a claim or dispute for which coverage is provided under the partnership's general liability policy.</p>\n<p>Paragon responds by arguing that the disputed liabilities all arise from the construction defect claims, the existence of which led FN Development to its decision to end the partnership relation with Paragon, and Continental has already conceded that such claims (or at least many of them) are covered under its policy. Since FN Development is doing nothing more than asserting a claim of liability for covered claims, Paragon is entitled to a defense. The fact that the assertion of FN Development's claim of liability is based on contract (the partnership agreements) cannot preclude Paragon's entitlement to coverage, given the principles recently articulated by the Supreme Court in <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vandenberg,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In order to prevail on a motion for the summary adjudication of the duty to defend, \"the insured need only show that the underlying claim <i>may</i> fall within policy coverage.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 300, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158094/montrose-chemical-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

There is no duty \"where the only potential for liability turns on a resolution of a legal question. . . .' [Citation.]\" (<i>McLaughlin v. National Union Fire Ins.

Continental, having already provided a defense for the construction defect claims as to which a potential for coverage did exist, had no legal obligation to defend Paragon in FN Development's action seeking to allocate the burden of what are necessarily (vis-\u00e0-vis Continental) <i>uninsured</i> claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The FN Development Action Seeks To Enforce A Claim For Intangible Economic Interests, Not Property Damage</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In the present case, FN Development sued Paragon to recover economic losses resulting from the operation of their partnership business, not for property damage. It is settled that property damage coverage under a liability policy, such as the one issued here by Continental, extends only to physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, tangible property. \"Damage for lost profits, loss of investment or other harm to one's economic interest constitute injuries to <i>intangible</i> property which by definition fall outside the scope of the policy. [Citation.]\" (<i>McLaughlin v. National Union Fire Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1150, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286208\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286208/mclaughlin-v-national-union-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>; italics in original.) The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*857</span> FN Development action essentially sought to end the business relationship with Paragon and apportion profits and losses in accordance with their existing agreements. Nowhere in its complaint did FN Development allege that <i>it</i> had sustained property damage. Rather, it sought a declaration that Paragon was \"wholly\" liable for certain obligations incurred by the partnership, that is, the construction defect claims. This is essentially a claim relating to the proper <i>apportionment of a partnership loss</i> between partners.</p>\n<p>To put it more specifically, FN Development was seeking to hold Paragon responsible for Paragon's alleged share of partnership losses arising from the construction defect claims. For at least two reasons there was no <i>potential</i> for coverage. First, there was never a possibility that Paragon would be held liable to FN Development for causing <i>property damage</i> since no claim was made for physical injury to tangible property.</p>\n<p>Second, and most significantly, the only asserted construction defect claims that would necessarily be involved in the FN Development action were those claims that were <i>not</i> covered under Continental's policy. As the trial court acknowledged (and Paragon does not dispute), all of the asserted construction defect claims that were potentially covered under Continental's policy were in fact already being defended by Continental. Thus, the real undisclosed rationale for Paragon's argument is that Continental had an indirect obligation to defend Paragon from claims that Continental had no obligation to defend when those same claims had been asserted directly by the injured third party homeowner claimants. To sanction Paragon's claim of coverage would be to impose on Continental a liability that it never agreed to assume.</p>\n<p>In support of its argument that Continental did have a duty to defend claims asserted in the FN Development action, Paragon cites <i>Vol's Painting &amp; Dry wall v. Allstate Ins. Co.</i> (1975) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157179\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157179/vals-painting-drywall-inc-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span> </a></span>(<i>Vol's Painting)</i><i>.</i> In <i>Vol's Painting,</i> one of Val's employee's was injured when he fell from scaffolding rented by a third party vendor, Ray-Cron. Ray-Cron, which had required Val's to sign an indemnity agreement as a condition of the scaffolding rental, filed a cross-complaint against Val's alleging Val's was liable for any injury because (1) it was Val's negligence that resulted in the injuries, and (2) Val's indemnity agreement required it to indemnify Ray-Cron for any injury resulting from the use of the scaffolding.</p>\n<p>Val's tendered the defense of the cross-complaint to its insurer under its comprehensive general liability insurance policy. The tender was denied. The appellate court concluded that two possible theories could be detected from the cross-complaint-implied and contractual indemnity. The court held that because the cross-complaint arose out of a suit for damages for bodily injury, <i>a risk which was of the nature and kind covered by the policy,</i> the insurer had a duty to defend even though ultimately it might not be liable to indemnify the insured. (<i>Val's <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Painting,</span> supra</span>,</i> 53 Cal.App.3d at 584, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157179\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157179/vals-painting-drywall-inc-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p><i>Val's Painting</i> is instructive in teaching that a claim for indemnity may create the potential for coverage if the claim arose out of a suit for damages for a risk of the nature and kind covered by the policy. Here, however, FN Development was not really seeking to enforce a claim of indemnity. It was attempting to allocate a partnership loss arising from the existence of construction defect claims which necessarily were <i>not</i> covered by any liability policy issued by Continental. The covered claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*858</span> would not contribute to partnership losses; to the extent of Continental's policy limits, such claims were (or would be) necessarily settled or otherwise satisfied by Continental.</p>\n<p>FN Development sought to impose this burden on Paragon through an action for a dissolution, an accounting and declaratory relief. Thus, in the present case, Paragon is essentially asking Continental to defend a dissolution action between partners simply because (at least some of) the partnership losses can be <i>traced back</i> to construction defect claims that homeowners were litigating against the partnership in other lawsuits. Continental, however, had already provided a defense to these suits, at least to the extent that they asserted construction defect claims that were actually or potentially covered under Continental's policy.<sup>[14]</sup> That, of course, was <i>not</i> the case in <i>Vol's Painting.</i> The cross-complaint for indemnity in that case was simply the vehicle by which the injured third party's claim was asserted against the insured. The insured was thereby effectively brought into the injury action as another defendant and its insurer had a clear obligation to provide a defense. Obviously, these are not the circumstances before us.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Paragon asserts FN Development's partnership claims created a <i>potential</i> for coverage because FN Development sought to hold Paragon liable for the economic consequences of property damage. For example, Paragon argues that FN Development settled some homeowner claims prior to the filing of the FN Development action, and then sought reimbursement for those payments.<sup>[15]</sup> We do not believe, however, that such allegations provide a legal basis for establishing coverage under Continental's policy. If Continental's policy actually covered such claims, then FN Development's claim for reimbursement should have been made directly to Continental. If Continental had <i>no</i> coverage exposure for such a direct claim, it must follow that a potential for coverage could not be created by the indirect assertion of that claim in a partnership lawsuit against Paragon. This conclusion is fully supported by case law.</p>\n<p>In <i>Giddings v.

The various litigants sought to recover for the reduced value of corporate holdings, misappropriation of corporate property, waste of corporate assets, and other related conduct.

The court held that the policies did not afford coverage for intangible economic interests and thus there was no duty to defend or indemnify in connection with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*859</span> the various lawsuits because there was no property damage. The court further held that economic losses do not constitute damage or injury to tangible property covered by a comprehensive general liability policy.

Ticor sought coverage from its liability insurer by arguing that the allegations against Ticor included allegations that it had facilitated the looting, converting, and misappropriation of corporate assets including \"real property and subsidiary manufacturing companies that produced rubber and metal products.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1710, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302801/ticor-title-ins-co-v-employers-ins-of-wausau/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>.) In rejecting Ticor's argument that the litigation should be viewed as a claim of property damage, the court emphasized that the underlying complaint did not suggest that TEC was seeking recovery for \"loss of use of tangible corporate property.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302801/ticor-title-ins-co-v-employers-ins-of-wausau/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court determined that allegations based on various business and contract transgressions did not create any potential for coverage under the standard general liability policy.

In this regard, when the fundamental nature of those transactions is economic, California courts have refused to find a duty to defend the lawsuit even though the litigation will encompass issues relating to property damage. For example, in <i>Miller v. Western General Agency, Inc.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306225/miller-v-western-general-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, the claimant sued the insured Millers in connection with the sale of their home. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306225/miller-v-western-general-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The claimant alleged that the Millers had failed to disclose the existence of defective plumbing that had subsequently failed and caused \"damage to real and personal property.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306225/miller-v-western-general-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Ruling that there was no duty to defend, we held in <i>Miller</i> that \"[t]he basis for [ ] complaint is not the alleged defective plumbing, although it might otherwise have been a part of [the claimant's] damages. What they are suing for is the tortious fraudulent conduct of the Millers which simply does not fall within the coverage of Central National's policy.\" (<i>Miller v. Western General Agency, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1151, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306225/miller-v-western-general-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>Just as in <i>Miller,</i> the basis of the FN Development action was not construction defect based liability. It was not asking the court to find that Paragon or anyone else had negligently damaged anyone's home.<sup>[17]</sup> Instead, FN Development and Paragon (through their several insurers, including Continental) were defending homeowners' construction defect lawsuits in other cases. In the FN Development action, FN Development asked the court to interpret the various agreements it and Paragon had executed over the years, and then render an appropriate accounting between them which allocated sole liability to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*861</span> Paragon for what necessarily had to be <i>uninsured</i> construction defect claims.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is also clear that the FN Development action arose from the several financial and partnership transactions between FN Development and Paragon, not from an accident causing damage to FN Development property. (See <i>Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Andrews</i> (9th Cir.1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548768\"><a href=\"/opinion/548768/safeco-insurance-company-of-america-a-washington-corporation-v-david-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 502 [\"Although the defective condition of the property is an element of [the asserted] claims, the defects cannot, even when interpreting the policy broadly, be considered the <i>cause</i> of [the claimant's] damages. The cause of the damage was [the insured's] alleged misrepresentations, which are not an `occurrence' or a `peril insured against' under the terms of the policy\"].) FN Development's action did not involve any occurrence or accident. To the contrary, it sought to dissolve the partnership in the face of irreconcilable economic differences with Paragon. Thus, by asking the court to interpret the various partnership documents, and then render an accounting, FN Development was seeking economic relief, not claiming property damage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Neither AIU Nor Vandenberg Support Paragon's Position</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The trial court appears to have relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>AIU</i> and <i>Vandenberg</i> in arriving at its conclusion that a basis for coverage existed under Continental's policy. We do not believe either of these cases supports the trial court's conclusion.</p>\n<p>While it is true that the <i>AIU</i> court sanctioned a coverage claim for a suit <i>in equity</i> prosecuted against an insured, it does not follow that <i>AIU</i> would impose coverage in <i>every</i> equitable case. As already noted, Continental's policy promised coverage of a suit seeking sums \"that the insured becomes <i>legally obligated</i> to pay as <i>damages</i> because of . . . <i>property damage</i> \" (italics added) which occurs during the policy period and is <i>caused</i> by an <i>occurrence. AIU</i> held that equitable orders (e.g., mandatory injunctions and orders compelling reimbursement of cleanup costs to the government) requiring the cleanup and remediation of toxic pollution caused by an insured's business activities would constitute damages that an insured was legally obligated to pay. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">AIU,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 51 Cal.3d at pp. 824-828, 833, 836-837, 840-841, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In short, the <i>AIU</i> court concluded that the phrase \"legally obligated\" meant \"required of the insured,\" <i>whether at law or in equity. (Id.</i> at pp. 824-825, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Nothing in <i>AIU,</i> however, suggests that the claim asserted against an insured still did not have to arise from <i>property damage</i> sustained by the claimant during the policy period which was caused by an occurrence (i.e., an <i>accident</i> or continued or repeated exposure to harmful conditions). In other words, reliance on the principles articulated in <i>AIU</i> does nothing more than beg the question of whether <i>a covered claim for property damage</i> has been asserted. It certainly does not answer it. Given general coverage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*862</span> principles, <i>AIU</i> provides no assistance to Paragon.</p>\n<p>The same conclusion applies to the <i>Vandenberg</i> decision. In that case, the Supreme Court specifically discussed the term \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" as that phrase is used in a general liability policy. It did so in the context of a liability insurer's denial of coverage for damages awarded against an insured on the ground that the damages were assessed on a <i>contractual</i> theory. The insurer, citing a number of Court of Appeal decisions, had argued that the phrase \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" referred only to a liability based upon a breach of duty imposed by law, that is, based on <i>tort</i> not on contract.</p>\n<p>The insured in <i>Vandenberg</i> was held liable for the breach of a long-term real property lease based on the contamination of soils located on the leased property and the underlying groundwater.<sup>[18]</sup> The court held, however, that whether the third party's claim was based on tort or contract was not the proper question. Rather, it was the <i>\"nature of the damage and the risk involved,</i> in light of particular policy provisions, [which would] control coverage.\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vandenberg,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 21 Cal.4th at p. 839, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court specifically rejected the proposition that the phrase \"legally obligated to pay\" necessarily excluded coverage for liability arising from a breach of contract. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 839, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citation.]\" (<i>Ibid.;</i> italics added.) To conclude, however, that such phrase could only refer to a tort claim asserted against the insured would ignore settled principles of insurance contract interpretation. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p><i>Vandenberg</i> applied that principle: \"A reasonable layperson would certainly understand `legally obligated to pay' to refer to any obligation which is binding and enforceable under the law, whether pursuant to contract or tort liability. Further, a reasonable layperson, cognizant that he or she is purchasing a `general liability' insurance policy, would not conclude such coverage term only refers to liability pled in tort, and thus entirely excludes liability pled on a theory of breach of contract. Under general insurance principles, we must interpret the phrase `legally obligated to pay as damages' in accordance with the ordinary and popular sense, not the legalistic, and erroneously premised, interpretation of the language urged by insurers.\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vandenberg,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 21 Cal.4th at p. 840, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Accordingly, the legal theory asserted by the claimant is immaterial to the determination of whether the risk is covered.' [Citation.] . . . `The expression \"legally obligated\" connotes legal responsibility that is <i>broad</i> in scope. It is directed at civil liability . . . [which] can arise from either unintentional (negligent) or intentional tort, under common law, statute, or contract.' [Citation.] . . . `The coverage agreement [which] embraces \"all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*863</span> to pay as damages . . . .\" . . . is intentionally broad enough to include the insured's obligation to pay damages for breach of contract as well as for tort, within limitations imposed by other terms of the coverage agreement (e.g. bodily injury and property damage as defined, caused by an occurrence) and by the exclusions . . . .' [Citation.]\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vandenberg,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 21 Cal.4th at p. 841, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court was only making the simple point that it was not the \"form of the proceeding\" (<i>ibid.</i>) that would control coverage, but rather that the issue would be resolved by a determination as to whether the acts of the insured had created a <i>risk covered under the policy</i> which resulted in either bodily injury or <i>property damage to another.</i> If those requirements were satisfied, it would not matter that the third party claimant's theory of recovery was based on contract rather than on tort.</p>\n<p>Given this understanding of <i>Vandenberg,</i> we can only conclude that it likewise provides no support for Paragon's argument for coverage. It is not that FN Development's claim was based on contract (i.e., the several partnership agreements) which precludes coverage, but rather the failure of the complaint in the FN Development action to seek <i>damages</i> for <i>property damage</i> caused by an <i>occurrence.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>DISPOSITION</i></h2>\n<p>The order to show cause is discharged. A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of December 11, 2000, granting Paragon's motion for summary adjudication and denying Continental's motion for summary judgment and to enter a new order denying Paragon's motion and granting summary judgment in favor of Continental. The stay of trial court proceedings heretofore issued shall be lifted on the date the remittitur is issued herein. Continental shall recover its costs in these writ proceedings.</p>\n<p>We concur: KITCHING and ALDRICH, JJ.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In addition to Paragon Homes, Inc., the real parties in interest in these writ proceedings include Irwin E. Garfield, Brian Catalde, Paramar Partners, Victorville Associates, Simi Valley Associates, MVE/SECO 3 &amp; 4 Associates and Perris Associates. To the extent that they had been formed and were engaged in construction activities during the relevant coverage period (October 2, 1986 to October 2, 1988), it appears that each of these individuals and entities was a named insured under the general liability policy issued by Continental that is the subject of the underlying action and out of which these writ proceedings arose. For the sake of simplicity and convenience, we will hereafter refer to all of these real parties in interest by the term \"Paragon.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  This underlying action was filed not only by FN Development Company (Alpha), but also by FN Development Company (Bravo) and FN Projects, Inc. All three of these related companies are California corporations and are subsidiaries of First Nationwide Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which was also named as a party plaintiff. Again, for the sake of simplicity and convenience, we hereafter collectively refer to these entities by the term FN Development. The underlying action filed by FN Development will be referred to as the FN Development action.</p>\n<p>[3]  Because of the nature of the issues presented by Continental's writ petition, we have greatly simplified our description of the many complicated business relationships entered into by Paragon and FN Development (and the several entities that are a part of each) and, for convenience, simply characterize such multiple business relationships by the singular term \"partnership.\" For our purposes, it is not necessary to include a detailed discussion of the nature and character of each of the several development projects in which they engaged or to make any distinctions between the various legal relationships that may have existed whether partnership, joint venture or otherwise. A detailed review of those relationships was set forth in the unpublished opinion of Division One of this district affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court's judgment in the underlying FN Development action (No. B123192, filed Feb. 28, 2001).</p>\n<p>[4]  The facts which we recite and upon which we rely are not in dispute and are disclosed by the documents filed by the parties in support of and in opposition to their competing motions for summary relief.</p>\n<p>[5]  This is the FN Development action identified in footnote <i>2, ante.</i> In its complaint, FN Development also alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, money had and received, constructive trust and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, FN Development alleged the following in paragraphs 167, 168 and 169 (the Fourth Cause of Action) of its complaint:\n</p>\n<p>\"167. Actual controversies have arisen and now exist between [FN Development] and the Paragon Developers regarding which entities are liable under the Paragon DMAs and applicable law for any defects in the construction performed by or under the supervision of the Paragon Developers. Specifically, [FN Development] contend[s] that the Paragon Developers that are parties to each of the Paragon DMAs or who have guaranteed the obligations of the developer under such DMAs, are wholly responsible for any construction defects arising from any of the projects subject to such DMAs, whereas the Paragon Developers dispute this contention.</p>\n<p>\"168. [FN Development] desire[s] a judicial determination of [its] rights and duties and a declaration as to whether the Paragon Developers are wholly liable for any and all construction defects arising from any of the projects subject to the Paragon DMAs.</p>\n<p>\"169. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that [FN Development] may ascertain [its] rights and duties under each of the Paragon DMAs with regard to present and future construction defect claims arising from the projects under such DMAs.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The modified Declarations page of Continental's policy included a long list of named insureds. It not only set forth the names of specific development project joint ventures or partnerships but also included an omnibus clause that provided: \"Any joint venture, partnership or corporation in which Paragon Homes, Inc. and/or Irwin Garfield, as individual and/or Garfield Development, Inc., 3.G Enterprise, Inc., or any subsidiary thereof retains majority interest and/or assumes direct management and/or control.\" There is <i>no</i> contention made herein by Paragon that this clause did not extend to provide \"named insured\" status under Continental's policy to each of the business entities involved in the several development projects out of which the construction defect claims arose.</p>\n<p>[8]  The policy obligated Continental to \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance applies. . . . This insurance applies only to `bodily injury' and `property damage' which occurs during the policy period. The `bodily injury' and `property damage' must be caused by an `occurrence.'\" \"Property damage\" was defined as <i>\"physical injury to tangible property,</i> including all resulting loss of use of that property.\" (Italics added.) \"Occurrence\" was defined as an <i>\"accident,</i> including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>[9]  This trial date was later continued until November 1997.</p>\n<p>[10]  In its letter rejecting Paragon's tender, Continental stated, in part: \"In reviewing the causes of action as pled in [FN Development's] First Amended Complaint, it would appear the only cause of action which even remotely could trigger the duty of defense and/or indemnity is the Fourth Cause of Action, Declaratory Relief\u0097Liability for Construction Defects. While the complaint references claims for construction defects and a judicial determination of responsibility for same, it is our opinion that neither the insuring agreement in Coverage A or Coverage B of the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form, CG 0001 (11-85) is triggered in this matter. [\u00b6] Furthermore, the defective pipe conditions allegedly existing at the `Mountain View East' development with project inception in November, 1990, would not be the subject of coverage under the Continental Casualty Company policy issued to Paragon Homes, Inc., with expiration date of October 2, 1988.[\u00b6] In consideration of the above, we must respectfully decline to participate in the defense and/or indemnity of Paragon Homes, Inc. in the above-captioned litigation.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  FN Development's fourth cause of action for declaratory relief had previously been dismissed pursuant to a stipulation.</p>\n<p>[12]  In its pleading, Paragon alleged that \"[w]ith respect to the construction defect claims, a stipulation was entered into after trial dismissing those claims asserted in the Fourth Cause of Action. However, with respect to the Sixth Cause of Action, it was determined that the Paragon entities owed to the FN entities $1,612,500.00 for liability for damage resulting from construction defects. The FN entities were permitted to introduce at trial the fact of pending construction defect litigation against plaintiffs and the FN entities, and evidence of proof of actual construction defects. As a result, an element of damages for such construction defects was included in the judgment against MVE/SECO 3 &amp; 4 Associates and plaintiffs were found to be obligated for 50% of a $3,225,000.00 <i>loss</i> <i>attributable</i> to construction defects, or $1,612,500.\" (Italics added.)\n</p>\n<p>It thus appears, from Paragon's own allegations, that FN Development's efforts to hold Paragon <i>solely</i> liable for the construction defect claims failed. We assume that the apparent equal division of the burden (after the cognizable amount was first determined as a part of the accounting process) resulted from either the provisions of the parties' several agreements or the application of general partnership law principles.</p>\n<p>[13]  We note that, according to the declaration of Paragon's counsel filed in support of its motion for summary adjudication, all but one of Paragon's other primary insurers had agreed to defend the FN Development action.</p>\n<p>[14]  The record does not disclose any argument or contention by Paragon that Continental has failed or refused to provide a defense to any of the underlying construction defect claims asserted against the Paragon-FN Development partnership where a potential for coverage existed under the Continental policy. Nor does Paragon contend that Continental has refused to provide a defense to any such potentially covered claims that might be asserted in the future.</p>\n<p>[15]  As an example of just how misdirected Paragon's argument is, it concedes that the final judgment against it in the FN Development action includes a sum of money awarded to FN Development to reimburse settlement costs incurred to replace defective pipes at a project called Mountain View East. What Paragon does not say, however, is that construction on this project started in 1990\u0097<i>two years after Continental's policy expired.</i> Indeed, there is some suggestion in the record that the entire amount attributable to construction defect claims that was included in the judgment against Paragon (see fn. 12, <i>ante</i>) arose from the Mountain View East project.</p>\n<p>[16]  There are several other cases employing similar reasoning. In <i>Devin v. United Services Auto. Ass'n.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296979/devin-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, the Devins were sued for failing to disclose that a house was \"sliding, slipping, settling, sinking, fracturing and buckling.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296979/devin-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>.) The court refused to find that the lawsuit involved claims of damage to property. Instead, the court reasoned that the buyers of the home were alleging that the Devins had caused \"a pecuniary loss\u0097the lost fair market value of the house.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1158, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296979/devin-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>.)\n</p>\n<p><i>American Int'l Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1558</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span> </span>provides another example. In that case, the court held that a general liability insurer had no duty to defend a bank that was sued for allegedly mishandling a loan which caused the claimants to lose the use of property they had purchased at considerable expense. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1562, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span>.) The court rejected the insured bank's effort to characterize the claims as property damage. Instead, the court found that there was no duty to defend because the bank had allegedly caused the claimants to suffer economic loss, not actual property damage. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1572, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>Finally, in <i>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Interbank Financial Services</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2131960\"><a href=\"/opinion/2131960/allstate-ins-co-v-interbank-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, the defendant <i>Interbank</i> allegedly gave bad advice with respect to certain tax shelter investments regarding thoroughbred racehorses. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 827, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2131960\"><a href=\"/opinion/2131960/allstate-ins-co-v-interbank-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>.) It was sued by the investors, who alleged that they had been given improper advice and that Interbank had \"`failed to properly manage and care for the plaintiff's personal property,'\" which had allegedly \"`been negligently and carelessly damaged.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 830, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2131960\"><a href=\"/opinion/2131960/allstate-ins-co-v-interbank-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>.) The court refused to find that Interbank's liability insurer had a duty to defend the lawsuit. Instead of focusing on potential derivative harm to the racehorses, the court focused on the specific allegations of the lawsuit pertaining to bad investment advice. After identifying the fundamentally economic nature of the transaction, the court held that \"although the insureds attempt to characterize the claims differently, the clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice and that the plaintiffs lost money in a tax shelter investment.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 830-831, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2131960\"><a href=\"/opinion/2131960/allstate-ins-co-v-interbank-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>[17]  Paragon makes much of the fact that FN Development was allowed to put on evidence concerning the construction defect claims during the trial of the accounting and dissolution cause of action. However, the record makes clear FN Development's purpose in tendering such evidence. It was because the <i>existence,</i> rather than the specific merits, of such litigation had an impact on the financial issues that the court was asked to address by FN Development's complaint. Such evidence provided a basis for FN Development's claimed right to terminate its agreements with Paragon and was relevant to the question of the market value of the various projects as well as the financial performance of, and the risks inherently involved in, those projects. As Paragon itself argued (in support of its motion in the trial court to dismiss FN Development's Fourth Cause of Action for declaratory relief), \"This is a partnership fiduciary duty and accounting case, not a construction defect case.\" FN Development also emphasized that it \"did <i>not</i> seek <i>damages</i> for claims of construction defects.\" Thus, we find the receipt of evidence concerning the existence and status of the construction defect claims in the FN Development action provides no support for Paragon's arguments here.</p>\n<p>[18]  In <i>Vandenberg,</i> the lessor had alleged, and an arbitrator had subsequently held, that the lessee's improper installation, maintenance and use of waste oil storage tanks on the leased property had caused the contamination of soils and groundwater and the lessee's acts constituted a breach of the lease agreements. A $4 million award by the arbitrator was subsequently confirmed by the judgment of the superior court.</p>\n\n</div>",

We conclude that the franchisees had sufficient contacts with California through their relationship with their California franchiser, and that the tort claims alleged against the franchisees in a cross-complaint filed in a California action stemming from the food poisoning incidents were sufficiently related to the franchisees' contacts in California, to justify this state's exercise of jurisdiction over the franchisees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1993, customers of Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in several states, including Washington, suffered from exposure to Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria traced to hamburgers sold at the restaurants. Many fell ill and some died.</p>\n<p>Foodmaker, Inc., of which Jack-in-the-Box is a division, is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Diego, California. It blamed the E. coli contamination on its meat suppliers, including the Vons Companies, Inc. (Vons). Vons processed hamburger patties in its El Monte, California plant and shipped them to Foodmaker for use in Jack-in-the-Box restaurants.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> Litigation soon followed. Eighty-five Jack-in-the-Box franchisees from California and other states, whose customers had <i>not</i> been injured, sued Foodmaker, Vons, and other meat processors, in an action brought in the San Diego County Superior Court. The action stated causes of action for negligence, breach of implied warranty, breach of contract, and other claims, and sought substantial damages for loss of business caused by the adverse publicity that followed the E. coli outbreak.</p>\n<p>Foodmaker cross-complained against Vons and the other meat suppliers. Foodmaker's cross-complaint alleged breach of warranty and of contract, as well as negligence, negligent interference with economic relations, and other claims. It alleged the suppliers delivered contaminated meat to Foodmaker, and that this conduct exposed Foodmaker to liability both to injured customers and to franchisees who had lost business after the E. coli outbreak.</p>\n<p>Vons then filed the cross-complaint that is the subject of this appeal.<sup>[1]</sup> It asserted causes of action against Foodmaker, several slaughterers and meat packers, and several Jack-in-the-Box franchisees, including Seabest Foods, Inc. (Seabest) and Washington Restaurant Management, Inc. (WRMI). Seabest, beginning in 1988, and WRMI, beginning in 1987, were owners of Jack-in-the-Box franchises in Washington State at which E. coli contamination had injured or killed Jack-in-the-Box customers.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Vons's cross-complaint alleged the injuries caused by the E. coli contamination would have been avoided had Foodmaker and its franchisees cooked the hamburgers at the proper temperature. Specifically, it alleged Foodmaker, Seabest, and WRMI had failed to follow proper procedures for cooking the meat, and that their procedures were \"systematically deficient when measured against industry standards.\" In addition, it alleged Foodmaker, Seabest, and WRMI had failed to follow government standards for cooking the meat at a proper temperature, that Foodmaker had failed to inform its franchisees of the applicable government regulations, that the \"standard\" grills used by Foodmaker, Seabest, and WRMI were below the industry norm and lacked various safety features, and that Foodmaker, Seabest, and WRMI failed to require adequate qualifications and training for their cooks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*442</span> The cross-complaint asserted causes of action against Seabest and WRMI for negligence, negligent and intentional interference with economic advantage, and comparative and equitable indemnity. Vons sought damages for its own loss of business, as well as indemnification for any liability that might be imposed upon it for injury to Jack-in-the-Box customers in other actions, and for liability that might be imposed upon it for the claims of the franchisees in the current action.</p>\n<p>Seabest and WRMI appeared specially and moved to quash service of process on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court considered evidence of Seabest's contacts with California, including the circumstance that a majority of its board of directors lived in California and had signed franchise agreements, leases, and a security agreement with Foodmaker in California. One of Seabest's leases and its security agreement with Foodmaker listed the franchisee's home office address as being in Granada Hills, California. Although most of its business with Foodmaker was conducted with Foodmaker's Washington office, Seabest conducted some business by mail and telephone with Foodmaker at Foodmaker's corporate headquarters in San Diego. Seabest officers attended multiple training sessions offered by Foodmaker in California, and met with Foodmaker representatives in San Diego before entering the franchise agreements, and again thereafter to resolve a dispute unrelated to the present litigation.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the franchise agreements for Seabest's 10 Washington restaurants provided that any contract disputes would be litigated in California under California law, and that the franchisees would meet Foodmaker's specifications in providing training, following cooking procedures, and using equipment. The agreement specified that the franchisees must purchase ingredients, materials, and supplies from sources approved by Foodmaker, which might include Foodmaker itself. In fact, Seabest purchased most of its food and all of its hamburger patties from Foodmaker. It received delivery of food from Foodmaker's Washington warehouse, but was sent invoices by (and sent payments to) the San Diego Foodmaker headquarters \u0097 at first by mail, and then through a Colorado telephone exchange. Seabest also made its royalty and rent payments to Foodmaker in the same manner. Seabest employed a San Diego accountant to prepare the monthly financial statement it was required to send to Foodmaker headquarters in San Diego. During high volume periods, Seabest remitted up to $450,000 a month to Foodmaker.</p>\n<p>Foodmaker inspectors from California occasionally inspected Seabest's restaurants, and Foodmaker once sent an auditor from its San Diego office to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> audit Seabest's books. Seabest also made equipment purchases from Foodmaker in California. Payment for equipment purchases for one restaurant totaled $233,217.</p>\n<p>WRMI had less extensive contacts with Foodmaker in California, conducting almost all of its business with Foodmaker through Foodmaker's Washington office. Nonetheless, WRMI's three franchise agreements were negotiated in California, and one of the individual franchisees executed original franchise agreements in California. These franchise agreements provided that contract disputes would be litigated in California under California law, and also controlled the franchisee's purchases of ingredients, training, equipment, and cooking procedures in the same manner as the Seabest agreements. In addition, the president of WRMI met once with Foodmaker representatives in San Diego to negotiate regarding two initial franchises, and attended training on another occasion in San Diego. He also had telephone conversations regarding the potential sale of a franchise with a manager employed at Foodmaker's San Diego office. His application to purchase a third franchise was forwarded to the San Diego office of Foodmaker, and that office in turn returned the approved franchise and an assignment of the individual franchises to the WRMI corporation.</p>\n<p>The president of WRMI attended yearly meetings in California with Foodmaker dealing with WRMI business, and also traveled to California six to eight times to represent Jack-in-the-Box franchisees other than WRMI in policy discussions with Foodmaker. He received monthly accounts receivable statements from the San Diego office. He purchased 70 percent of his food supplies and all of his hamburger patties from Foodmaker. He was sent invoices by Foodmaker's Washington center and received his deliveries from that location, but he received a monthly statement for his food purchases from Foodmaker in San Diego. The hamburger patties delivered to him from that center originally came from California suppliers. He originally mailed his royalty, rent, and food payments to Foodmaker's San Diego address, and later paid the bills by telephone to a bank located in California. He also sent monthly income statements and a yearly accounting to Foodmaker in San Diego. His employees had occasional phone conversations with Foodmaker in California regarding financial matters, and he occasionally received updated training materials from Foodmaker in California. After the E. coli outbreak, he had conversations with Foodmaker in California regarding an agreement to terminate his franchises, as noted below. Finally, two WRMI employees received training in California on one occasion, and WRMI purchased cash registers and other sales tracking equipment directly from Foodmaker in California.</p>\n<p>There also was evidence that during litigation involving the motions to quash, Foodmaker reached an agreement with Seabest and WRMI under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> which the franchisees assigned the franchises back to Foodmaker. In addition, Foodmaker agreed to defend and indemnify the franchisees to the extent their insurers refused to defend and indemnify them against personal injury claims brought by injured Jack-in-the-Box customers, as well as the claims brought in the present litigation.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The trial court granted the motions to quash, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, also ordering Vons to pay Seabest's and WRMI's costs on appeal. We granted Vons's petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>(1) California's long-arm statute authorizes California courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of California. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 410.10.) A state court's assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who has not been served with process within the state comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the federal Constitution if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate \"`traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\" (<i>International Shoe Co.</i> v. <i>Washington</i> (1945) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>, 316 [90 L.Ed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*445</span> 95, 102, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">66 S.Ct. 154</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">161 A.L.R. 1057</span>] (<i>International Shoe</i>); see also <i>Burnham</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112436\"><a href=\"/opinion/112436/burnham-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-marin/\">495 U.S. 604</a></span>, 618-619 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112436\"><a href=\"/opinion/112436/burnham-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-marin/\">109 L.Ed.2d 631</a></span>, 644-645, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112436\"><a href=\"/opinion/112436/burnham-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-marin/\">110 S.Ct. 2105</a></span>] (<i>Burnham</i>).)</p>\n<p>(2) Recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court describe two bases for limiting a state's exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. The first recognizes limits on a state's assertion of jurisdiction designed to ensure fairness to nonresident defendants. The second recognizes the mutual limits on the states' sovereign power to exercise jurisdiction in a federal system.</p>\n<p>As the high court has explained, each individual has a liberty interest in not being subject to the judgments of a forum with which he or she has established no meaningful minimum \"contacts, ties or relations.\" (<i>Burger King Corp.</i> v. <i>Rudzewicz</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, 471-472 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">85 L.Ed.2d 528</a></span>, 540, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">105 S.Ct. 2174</a></span>] (<i>Burger King</i>) [approving Florida court's exercise of jurisdiction over franchise dispute involving Michigan franchisee and Florida franchiser], quoting <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 U.S. at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at p. 104].)

The sovereignty of each State, in turn, implied a limitation on the sovereignty of all of its sister States....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 293 [62 L.Ed.2d at p. 499].)</p>\n<p>(3) Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. A nonresident defendant may be subject to the <i>general</i> jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are \"substantial ... continuous and systematic.\" (<i>Perkins</i> v. <i>Benguet Mining Co.</i> (1952) <span class=\"citation no-link\">342 U.S. 437</span>, 445, 446 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">96 L.Ed. 485</span>, 492, 493, <span class=\"citation no-link\">72 S.Ct. 413</span>]; see also <i>Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia</i> v. <i>Hall</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">466 U.S. 408</a></span>, 414-415 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">80 L.Ed.2d 404</a></span>, 410-411, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">104 S.Ct. 1868</a></span>] (<i>Helicopteros</i>).) In such a case, \"it is not necessary that the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant's business relationship to the forum.\" (<i>Cornelison</i> v. <i>Chaney</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, 147 [127 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*446</span> Cal.

Such a defendant's contacts with the forum are so wide-ranging that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction. (See <i>Burnham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112436\"><a href=\"/opinion/112436/burnham-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-marin/\">supra,</a></span></i> 495 U.S. at p. 618 [109 L.Ed.2d at p. 644] (plur. opn. by Scalia, J.).) No question of general jurisdiction arises, however, in the case before us.</p>\n<p>If the nonresident defendant does not have substantial and systematic contacts in the forum sufficient to establish general jurisdiction, he or she still may be subject to the <i>specific</i> jurisdiction of the forum, if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at pp. 472-473 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 540-541]), and the \"controversy is related to or `arises out of' a defendant's contacts with the forum.\" (<i>Helicopteros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">supra,</a></span></i> 466 U.S. at p. 414 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 411]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 540-541].) It is this type of personal jurisdiction that Vons seeks to establish in this case.</p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court has described the forum contacts necessary to establish specific jurisdiction as involving variously a nonresident who has \"purposefully directed\" his or her activities at forum residents (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541]), or who has \"purposefully derived benefit\" from forum activities (<i>id.</i> at p. 473 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541]), or \"`purposefully avail[ed himself or herself] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 475 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 542].) The court also has referred to the requisite forum contact as involving a nonresident defendant who \"`deliberately' has engaged in significant activities with a State [citation] or has created `continuing obligations' between himself and residents of the forum [citation]\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 475-476 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543]), concluding that in such cases the defendant \"manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business [in the forum], and because his activities are shielded by `the benefits and protections' of the forum's laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 476 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543].)</p>\n<p>According to the high court, it is fair to subject defendants to specific jurisdiction, because their forum activities should put them on notice that they will be subject to litigation in the forum. That is, \"[w]hen a corporation `purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,' [citation] it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there, and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> severing its connection with the state.\" (<i>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra,</i> 444 U.S. at p. 297 [62 L.Ed.2d at p. 501].) This element of fair warning gives \"a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 297 [62 L.Ed.2d at p. 501].)</p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court has explained, for example, that a state properly may exercise specific jurisdiction when it \"`asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State' and those products subsequently injure forum consumers. [Citation.] Similarly a publisher who distributes magazines in a distant State may fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly defamatory story. [Citations.]\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 473 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541].) And in the case of litigation arising out of an ongoing franchise agreement, the high court has found proper a Florida court's exercise of specific jurisdiction over a franchise operator located in Michigan, emphasizing that \"parties who `reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state' are subject to regulation and sanctions in the other State for the consequences of their activities.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>(4) A state may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident who purposefully avails himself or herself of forum benefits, because the state has \"a `manifest interest' in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors. [Citations.] Moreover, where individuals `purposefully derive benefit' from their interstate activities [citation] it may well be unfair to allow them to escape having to account in other States for consequences that arise proximately from such activities.\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at pp. 473-474 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541].) Further, \"because `modern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity,' it usually will not be unfair to subject him to the burdens of litigating in another forum for disputes relating to such activity.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 474 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541].)</p>\n<p>Finally, in analyzing the exercise of specific jurisdiction, \"[o]nce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with `fair play and substantial justice.'\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 476 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543], quoting <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> U.S. at p. 320 [90 L.Ed. at p. 104].) Courts may evaluate the burden on the defendant of appearing in the forum, the forum state's interest in adjudicating the claim, the plaintiff's interest in convenient and effective relief within the forum, judicial economy, and \"the `shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.'\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 477 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543].)</p>\n<p>This court examined the problem of specific jurisdiction in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>. There we held that a California resident could sue a Nebraska defendant in California for wrongful death in connection with an accident that occurred in Nevada. Because the defendant was engaged in the business of hauling goods by truck and made fairly frequent deliveries in California, and the accident occurred while he was en route to California for further deliveries, we found a \"substantial nexus between plaintiff's cause of action and defendant's activities in California.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 149.) We explained that the appropriate inquiry is whether the plaintiff's cause of action \"arises out of or has a substantial connection with a business relationship defendant has purposefully established with California.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>) We commented that if, as we found, the defendant's activities are not so wide ranging as to justify general jurisdiction, \"then jurisdiction depends upon the quality and nature of his activity in the forum <i>in relation to</i> the particular cause of action. In such a situation, the cause of action must arise out of an act done or transaction consummated in the forum, or defendant must perform some other act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. Thus, as the relationship of the defendant with the state seeking to exercise jurisdiction over him grows more tenuous, the scope of jurisdiction also retracts, and fairness is assured by limiting the circumstances under which the plaintiff can compel him to appear and defend. The crucial inquiry concerns the character of defendant's activity in the forum, whether the cause of action <i>arises out of or has a substantial connection</i> with that activity, and upon the balancing of the convenience of the parties and the interests of the state in assuming jurisdiction.\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 147-148, fn. omitted, italics added, citing <i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla</i> (1958) <span class=\"citation no-link\">357 U.S. 235</span>, 250-253 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">2 L.Ed.2d 1283</span>, 1295-1298, <span class=\"citation no-link\">78 S.Ct. 1228</span>]; <i>McGee</i> v. <i>International Life Ins.

(<i>State of Oregon</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. App.4th 1550</span>, 1557 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. Rptr.2d 909</span>].) Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, however, it becomes the defendant's burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at pp. 476-477 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 543-544].) When there is conflicting evidence, the trial court's factual determinations are not disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. (<i>Felix</i> v. <i>Bomoro Kommanditgesellschaft</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">196 Cal. App.3d 106</span>, 111 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">241 Cal. Rptr. 670</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 A.L.R.4th 1</span>].) When no conflict in the evidence exists, however, the question of jurisdiction is purely one of law and the reviewing court engages in an independent review of the record. (<i>Great-West Life Assurance Co.</i> v. <i>Guarantee Co. of North America</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">205 Cal. App.3d 199</span>, 204 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">252 Cal. Rptr. 363</span>].)</p>\n<p>(5b) We conclude that this state may exercise specific jurisdiction over Seabest and WRMI. Indeed, this case closely resembles <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, which, we believe, largely governs the outcome here. As we explain, the cross-defendants here, like the defendants in <i>Burger King,</i> purposefully availed themselves of benefits in the forum by reaching out to forum residents to create an ongoing franchise relationship.</p>\n<p>In <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, a Florida corporation sued its Michigan franchisee in the federal district court in Florida for breach of the franchise agreement. The franchisee appeared specially and claimed that because he was a Michigan resident doing business only in Michigan, and because the claim did not \"arise\" in Florida, the district court lacked jurisdiction over him. The Supreme Court disagreed. It held the franchisee, through his continuing contractual obligations to the Florida corporation, purposefully had availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in Florida. The high court declared that, although a nonresident defendant does not necessarily become subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum state simply by entering into a contract with a resident of the forum (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 478 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 544-545]), the exercise of specific jurisdiction over the out-of-state franchisee was appropriate in the case before it because of ongoing franchise relations very similar to those involved here.</p>\n<p>As already noted, the court declared that \"with respect to interstate contractual obligations, we have emphasized that parties who `reach out <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state' are subject to regulation and sanctions in the other State for the consequences of their activities.'\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 473 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541].) The court observed that the dispute in question grew out of a contract that had a \"substantial connection\" with the forum state. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 479 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 545], italics omitted.) The court acknowledged that the franchisee was supervised directly by the Michigan Burger King office, but noted that, as in the present case, the franchisee made monthly payments to (and agreed that his operations would be regulated by) corporate headquarters in the forum state. It was important to the court that the Michigan franchisee, although he had no physical presence in Florida, had agreed to an ongoing contractual relationship under which it was established that any disputes would be governed by Florida law. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 481 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 546-547].)</p>\n<p>The court found it significant that, as in the case before us, the franchisee knew he was affiliating himself with a business with headquarters in the forum state, and that his operations would be supervised by that headquarters. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 480 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 545-546].) The franchisee had reached out beyond Michigan and negotiated with a Florida corporation to take advantage of the significant benefits that would flow from affiliation with the Burger King name and organization. The court stated: \"In light of [the franchisee's] voluntary acceptance of the long-term and exacting regulation of his business from Burger King's Miami headquarters, the `quality and nature' of his relationship to the company in Florida can in no sense be viewed as `random,' `fortuitous,' or `attenuated.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 480 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 545].) The court cautioned that no mechanical test exists to determine whether a defendant purposefully has availed himself or herself of forum benefits by entering into a contract in the forum. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 478-479 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 545].) Rather, the court \"emphasized the need for a `highly realistic' approach\" in which the court examines prior negotiations, future consequences of the contract, the terms of the contract, and the parties' dealings with each other. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 479 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 545].)</p>\n<p>The court's discussion in <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, makes it clear that if Foodmaker had sued Seabest and WRMI in California in a breach of contract action based on the franchise agreements, it would have had no difficulty in establishing California's jurisdiction. As in <i>Burger King,</i> the franchisees here reached out to the California Foodmaker business, and clearly sought out and benefited from the California business's multistate name recognition and organization. The franchisees purposefully undertook ongoing contractual obligations to the California business, and agreed that any disputes arising out of the contract not only would be governed by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> California law, but also would be <i>litigated in California.</i> Therefore, it was not only predictable that they might face litigation in California \u0097 it was <i>settled</i> that any litigation on the contract would occur in this forum. In addition, Seabest and WRMI made substantial and continuing purchases from Foodmaker in California. (See <i>Rocklin De Mexico, S.A.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">157 Cal. App.3d 91</span>, 95, 98 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">203 Cal. Rptr. 547</span>] [asserting regular purchasing contacts would induce a reasonable defendant to foresee the possibility of being brought into court in the forum].)</p>\n<p>If Foodmaker were to seek indemnification from Seabest or WRMI for any liability Foodmaker suffered as a result of Seabest's or WRMI's undercooking of meat in Washington, the contacts between the Washington franchisees and this forum and Foodmaker also were such that California's exercise of jurisdiction would be proper over the Washington franchisees. The franchise agreement, after all, provided that the Washington franchisees would prepare their products in conformance with Foodmaker's regulations, and any alleged failure to do so would create an injury that arose from the contract and from the Washington franchisees' contacts with California.</p>\n<p>That a court would have no difficulty finding specific jurisdiction in such hypothetical lawsuits brought by Foodmaker demonstrates that Seabest and WRMI purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of doing business with the California Foodmaker enterprise. They formed a substantial economic connection with this state. To require them to answer Vons's claim, as well, is not to allow a third party unilaterally to draw them into a connection with the state; rather, it was Seabest and WRMI who established the connection. Nor would the exercise of jurisdiction in this state over Vons's claim depend on \"random, fortuitous or attenuated\" contacts. Rather, as we have seen, Seabest and WRMI had an ongoing commercial relationship in this forum.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the court in <i>Burger King, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, did not specifically discuss the further requirement that the claim \"arise out of\" or be \"related to\" the defendant's forum activity in order to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction, and that the meaning of that requirement is implicated in the present case.<sup>[4]</sup> We also recognize that in <i>Burger King,</i> the claim involved a contract action that arose <i>directly</i> from the forum contact, that is, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> the ongoing franchise relationship, and that the litigation involved the same parties as were involved in the forum contact. The present case is distinguishable from <i>Burger King</i> in that the cross-complainant was not a party to the franchise contract, and thus the claim is not on the contract as was the dispute in <i>Burger King.</i> This distinction, however, does not render the exercise of specific jurisdiction improper.</p>\n<p>(7) A claim need not arise directly from the defendant's forum contacts in order to be sufficiently related to the contact to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction. Rather, as long as the claim bears a substantial connection to the nonresident's forum contacts, the exercise of specific jurisdiction is appropriate. The due process clause is concerned with protecting nonresident defendants from being brought unfairly into court in the forum, on the basis of random contacts. That constitutional provision, however, does not provide defendants with a shield against jurisdiction when the defendant purposefully has availed himself or herself of benefits in the forum. The goal of fairness is well served by the standard we originally set out in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, that is, there must be a <i>substantial connection</i> between the forum contacts and the plaintiff's claim to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 148.)</p>\n<p>As we said in <i>Cornelison,</i> and as the high court suggested in <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>, for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction the intensity of forum contacts and the connection of the claim to those contacts are inversely related. (See <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 U.S. at p. 317 [90 L.Ed. at pp. 102-103] [\"`Presence' in the state ... has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the liabilities sued on.... Conversely it has been generally recognized that the casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities ... are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there.\"].) The explanation we set out in <i>Cornelison</i> bears repeating: \"[A]s the relationship of the defendant with the state seeking to exercise jurisdiction over him grows more tenuous, the scope of jurisdiction also retracts, and fairness is assured by limiting the circumstances under which the plaintiff can compel him to appear and defend. The crucial inquiry concerns the character of defendant's activity in the forum, whether the cause of action <i>arises out of or has a substantial connection with that activity,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> and the balancing of the convenience of the parties and the interests of the state in assuming jurisdiction.\" (<i>Cornelison, supra,</i> 16 Cal.3d at p. 148, fn. omitted, italics added; see also <i>Northrup King</i> v. <i>Compania Productora Semillas</i> (8th Cir.1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 F.3d 1383</span>, 1388 [nature of defendant's contacts with forum \"closely interrelated\" with question of connection of contacts with plaintiff's cause of action]; Richman, <i>Review Essay, Part II \u0097 A Sliding Scale to Supplement the Distinction Between General and Specific Jurisdiction</i> (1984) 72 Cal.L.Rev. 1328, 1340 et seq. [viewing intensity of defendant's contacts and relationship of contacts to claim on a continuum, so that the greater the intensity of forum activity, the lesser the relationship required between the contact and the claim].) (5c) When, as here, the defendants sought out and maintained a continuing commercial connection with a California business, it is not necessary that the claim arise directly from the defendant's contacts in the state. Rather, as is discussed further below, because of the defendants' relationship with the forum, it is not unfair to require that they answer in a California court for an alleged injury that is substantially connected to the defendants' forum contacts.</p>\n<p>Seabest argues that the standard we set forth in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, and the result we reached in that case, are \"at or beyond the outer-most limits of what the Due Process Clause will countenance.\" (See also Brilmayer, <i>How Contacts Count: Due Process Limitations on State Court Jurisdiction</i> (1980) Sup. Ct. Rev. 77, 84 (<i>How Contacts Count</i>) [criticizing <i>Cornelison</i> for considering contacts in the forum that are merely <i>similar</i> to the nonforum conduct that injured the plaintiff].) It argues such a formulation erases the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction, and is inconsistent with cases decided by the United States Supreme Court \"insisting on a direct and concrete nexus between the forum, the specific allegations in a lawsuit, and the defendant's particularized activity in the forum as related to the allegations in the lawsuit to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p>We disagree. The high court has not provided precise criteria regarding the particular issue before us \u0097 that is, the necessary relationship between the plaintiff's cause of action and the defendant's contacts in the forum. It has stated the applicable standard in much broader terms than those proposed by Seabest, however, requiring only that a plaintiff's cause of action be \"related to or `arise[] out of' a defendant's contacts with the forum.\" (<i>Helicopteros, supra,</i> 466 U.S. at p. 414 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 410]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 540-541].) To require that there be a substantial nexus or connection between the plaintiff's cause of action and the defendant's forum contacts is in no way inconsistent with this standard, or with the rationale the high court has provided for the exercise of specific <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> jurisdiction. Nor does such a standard eliminate the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction, for it retains the requirement that specific jurisdiction be based upon a connection between the plaintiff's claim and the defendant's forum contacts.</p>\n<p>The formulation expressed in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span> \u0097 that the state may exercise specific jurisdiction if there is a substantial connection or nexus between forum contacts and the litigation \u0097 is not unique. The same flexibility and emphasis on the nature of the relationship between the claim and the forum contacts is demonstrated in the approach taken by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <i>In re Oil Spill by Amoco Cadiz Off Coast of France</i> (7th Cir.1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">699 F.2d 909</span> (<i>Amoco Cadiz</i>). There, the court of appeals, in an opinion by then Judge, now Chief Judge Posner, approved the federal district court's exercise of jurisdiction in Illinois over a Spanish shipbuilder in a case in which French citizens injured by an oil spill off the coast of France sued the shipbuilder in tort for negligent and defective design of the ship. The French citizens also sued affiliates of the shipowner's parent company for damage caused by negligent operation of the ship, and the affiliates of the parent company cross-claimed against the shipbuilder for indemnity.</p>\n<p>The court concluded that the Spanish shipbuilder's contacts with Illinois, that is, the course of negotiations and the signing of the shipbuilding contract in Illinois, were sufficiently connected to the oil spill off the coast of France to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction with respect to the claims of the French citizens injured by the spill. The court observed that although the French plaintiffs were not party to the contract negotiations in Illinois \u0097 just as Vons was not in contract with Seabest or WRMI \u0097 they were harmed by the shipowner's operation of the ship in its defective condition, \"and the negotiation and signing of the contract were critical steps in the chain of events that led to the oil spill.\" (<i>Amoco Cadiz, supra,</i> 699 F.2d at p. 917.) Noting that it was particularly reasonable to permit the court in Illinois to exercise jurisdiction to allow all claims arising out of a single catastrophe to be litigated in the same court, it concluded that the exercise of jurisdiction over the Spanish shipbuilder did not offend notions of due process. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has explained that the relatedness criterion requires only that the plaintiff's claim have a substantial connection with the defendant's forum activities to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction. (<i>Third Nat. Bank in </i><i>Nashville</i> v. <i>Wedge Group Inc.</i> (6th Cir.1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">882 F.2d 1087</span>, 1091.) In that case, the defendant was a Delaware corporation that owned a subsidiary that did business in Tennessee and was involved in the subsidiary's financial transactions in Tennessee. Plaintiff Third National <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> Bank sued the Delaware corporation in Tennessee to enforce Third National Bank's rights as a secured creditor under contracts the defendant's subsidiary had entered into with it. Defendant argued the action did not arise out of its own business contacts with the forum, so that the Tennessee court could not properly exercise jurisdiction. The federal appeals court disagreed, stating that the relatedness element of specific jurisdiction \"does not require that the cause of action formally `arise from' defendant's contacts with the forum; rather, this criterion requires only `that the cause of action, of whatever type, <i>have a substantial connection with</i> the defendant's in-state activities.' ... `Only when the operative facts of the controversy are not related to the defendant's contact with the state can it be said that the cause of action does not arise from that [contact].'\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>) The defendant's contacts in the forum had a \"close relationship\" with the action, because defendant interjected itself into loan negotiations between the bank and the subsidiary, was a party to a tax sharing agreement that formed a part of the bank's claim, and deposited funds with the bank to induce it to enter into the loan agreement with the subsidiary. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>)</p>\n<p>The federal circuit also has chosen to apply a flexible standard, deciding in <i>Akro Corp.</i> v. <i>Luker</i> (Fed. Cir.1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687372\"><a href=\"/opinion/687372/the-akro-corporation-v-ken-luker/\">45 F.3d 1541</a></span> that a California patent holder was subject to jurisdiction in an action for declaratory judgment of noninfringement in Ohio, because the patent holder had sought to protect the patent in Ohio and because the patent holder had entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with an Ohio company not involved in the litigation. As for the relationship between the action and the defendant's forum contacts, the court observed that forum contacts need not be directed at the plaintiff in order to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction, and that the \"arising out of or relating to\" standard is in the disjunctive, and is intended as a relaxed, flexible standard, rather than one requiring that the plaintiff's claim arise out of the forum contact in any narrow sense. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1547.) The court also suggested that the more wide ranging the defendant's forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum contacts and the claim. (<i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>Northrup King</i> v. <i>Compania Productora Semillas, supra,</i> 51 F.3d at pp. 1387-1388 [considering \"connection\" between contacts and breach of contract cause of action; although some forum contacts, including meetings to discuss possible future business relations, were not directly related to the breach of contract claim, they were an \"essential part of the course of dealing\" between the parties leading to the contract]; <i>Francosteel Corp.</i> v. <i>M/V Charm</i> (11th Cir.1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665879\"><a href=\"/opinion/665879/francosteel-corporation-unimetal-normandy-v-mv-charm-her-engines/\">19 F.3d 624</a></span>, 627 [requiring simply that the defendant's contacts be \"related\" to the plaintiff's claim, but deciding that an international shipping contract calling for delivery of goods in the forum was insufficient when none of the events giving rise to the cause of action took place in the forum, none of the parties was a forum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> resident, the contract was negotiated outside the forum, and the loss occurred when the ship went down in international waters, before delivery]; <i>Vermeulen</i> v. <i>Renault, U.S.A., Inc.</i> (11th Cir.1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600388\"><a href=\"/opinion/600388/laura-ann-vermeulen-v-renault-usa-inc-regie-nationale-des-usines/\">985 F.2d 1534</a></span>, 1546, 1550 [contacts must be \"related\" to the plaintiff's claim or have given rise to it; Renault's design of an automobile for the United States market, advertising of the vehicle in the forum, and maintenance of a distribution network in the forum were sufficiently related to a products liability action, because they were \"inextricable links\" by which the forum resident obtained the vehicle].)</p>\n<p>In sum, considering the rationale of the specific jurisdiction doctrine, the language in which the high court has described the doctrine, and the federal cases discussed above applying the doctrine, we conclude that a nonresident defendant may be subject to the specific jurisdiction of this state if the defendant purposefully has availed itself of forum benefits through an ongoing franchise agreement and there is a substantial nexus or connection between the defendant's forum activities and the plaintiff's claim.</p>\n<p>Applying this standard, Vons has demonstrated a substantial nexus between WRMI's and Seabest's business contacts in California and Vons's tort claims against WRMI and Seabest. It is consistent with due process for Seabest and WRMI to be required to appear in the action in this forum; not only did they purposefully avail themselves of forum benefits through their ongoing, comprehensive and profitable contacts with the forum, but the plaintiff's claims against them bore a substantial relationship to their forum contact for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, the relationship Seabest and WRMI established in the forum drew these defendants and Vons into a relationship as alleged joint tortfeasors, with some joint liability and rights of indemnification. WRMI and Seabest established an ongoing contractual relationship with Foodmaker in California, and agreed to buy food supplies from Foodmaker (or from suppliers approved by Foodmaker) and to follow Foodmaker's directions in preparing food in the Washington restaurants. Seabest and WRMI actually bought all their hamburger patties from Foodmaker, which in turn was supplied by Vons and other purveyors. Although it was Foodmaker's Washington distribution center that delivered the meat to Seabest and WRMI, Seabest and WRMI paid Foodmaker's San Diego corporate headquarters for the supplies over a period of years. Accordingly, it appears that Seabest and WRMI bought Vons's contaminated meat from Foodmaker pursuant to the franchise agreement. It was pursuant to the ongoing contractual arrangement that the contaminated meat was delivered to Seabest and WRMI. Because of the contractual relationship in California, Vons, Seabest, and WRMI became, it is alleged, joint or concurrent tortfeasors with respect to the injured franchisees and consumers \u0097 Vons for supplying the contaminated meat, and Seabest and WRMI for failing to cook it properly. The contract in California put <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> Vons, Seabest, and WRMI in a position to become jointly liable under California law for harm caused by the meat (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1431, 1431.2; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 51, pp. 110, 112), thereby giving Vons a potential claim for indemnification against Seabest and WRMI. (See 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 89, p. 162.)<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the franchise relationship, with its uniform standards for cooking food, training employees, and buying equipment, itself was a source of injury to Vons. To the extent that, as the complaint alleged, Foodmaker's procedures were \"systematically deficient when measured by industry standards,\" and, as indicated by evidence offered below by Vons, these procedures were imposed on Seabest and WRMI pursuant to the franchise agreement, the contractual contact in California was a contributing cause of the injuries alleged to have been inflicted by Seabest and WRMI upon restaurant customers and other franchisees \u0097 as to which Vons assertedly had concurrent liability and some right to indemnification \u0097 as well as a contributing cause of the injuries to reputation claimed by Vons, because its meat was blamed for the illness and death of customers.<sup>[6]</sup> Accordingly, both the negligence claims and the claim for indemnification arose out of the contractual relationship between Foodmaker, WRMI, and Seabest, a relationship that had a substantial connection to California.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal below focused on an asserted lack of relationship between Vons, on the one hand, and Seabest and WRMI, on the other. The court suggested this lack of relationship was critical in determining whether the claim was sufficiently related to the forum contacts to permit the exercise of specific jurisdiction in California. Contrary to the Court of Appeal's thesis, however, the defendant's forum activities need not be directed at the <i>plaintiff</i> in order to give rise to specific jurisdiction. (See, e.g., <i>Keeton</i> v. <i>Hustler Magazine, Inc.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111116\"><a href=\"/opinion/111116/keeton-v-hustler-magazine-inc/\">465 U.S. 770</a></span>, 775 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111116\"><a href=\"/opinion/111116/keeton-v-hustler-magazine-inc/\">79 L.Ed.2d 790</a></span>, 798, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111116\"><a href=\"/opinion/111116/keeton-v-hustler-magazine-inc/\">104 S.Ct. 1473</a></span>] [publisher that distributes magazines to the public in a distant state may be held accountable in that forum for damage to victim of defamation]; <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span> [jurisdiction found although the defendant's business activities in California were not directed at the accident victim]; <i>Akro Corp.</i> v. <i>Luker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687372\"><a href=\"/opinion/687372/the-akro-corporation-v-ken-luker/\">supra,</a></span></i> 45 F.3d at p. 1547 [\"plaintiff need not be the forum resident toward whom any, much less all, of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> defendant's relevant activities were purposefully directed\"]; <i>Amoco Cadiz, supra,</i> 699 F.2d at p. 917 [French victims of oil spill may bring a tort action against a Spanish shipbuilder in an Illinois court; their claim \"could readily be said to arise from the negotiating and signing, in Illinois, of the [ship-building] contract,\" even though the negotiations obviously were not directed at the plaintiffs].) (8), (5d) The United States Supreme Court has stated more than once that the nexus required to establish specific jurisdiction is between the defendant, <i>the forum,</i> and the litigation (<i>Helicopteros, supra,</i> 466 U.S. at p. 411 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 409]; <i>Shaffer</i> v. <i>Heitner</i> (1977) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">433 U.S. 186</a></span>, 204 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">53 L.Ed.2d 683</a></span>, 697-698, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">97 S.Ct. 2569</a></span>]) \u0097 not between the plaintiff and the defendant. For the purpose of deciding whether a defendant has minimum contacts or purposefully has availed itself of forum benefits, the relevant contacts are said to be with the <i>forum,</i> because it is the defendant's choice to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the forum that subjects it to jurisdiction. (<i>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\">480 U.S. 102</a></span>, 112 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\">94 L.Ed.2d 92</a></span>, 104-105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\">107 S.Ct. 1026</a></span>] (plur. opn. by O'Connor, J.); <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at pp. 475, 479 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 542, 545]; <i>Helicopteros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">supra,</a></span></i> 466 U.S. at p. 414 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 409]; <i>Shaffer</i> v. <i>Heitner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">supra,</a></span></i> 433 U.S. at p. 204 [53 L.Ed.2d at pp. 697-698].)</p>\n<p>Seabest argues none of its physical contacts in California \u0097 by phone, visit, or letter \u0097 are relevant to the alleged injury, that is the illness caused by the undercooking of meat in Washington. It argues Vons's claims have no connection with California, asserting that these claims are based solely upon a violation of Washington law \u0097 that violation consisting of a failure to cook hamburgers to the proper internal temperature. This argument views both Vons's claim and Seabest's contacts with this forum far too narrowly. Seabest, like the defendant in <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, purposefully availed itself of an ongoing contractual relationship with a business in the forum, deriving substantial advantage from that business's multistate reputation and the standardization provided for under the franchise agreement. This forum contact bore a substantial relationship to the claimed injury to Vons's business and reputation, because Seabest acquired Vons's tainted meat from Foodmaker pursuant to purchases under the franchise agreement and cooked it according to the standards provided under the franchise agreement. Far from basing its claim solely or primarily upon an allegation that the franchisees violated Washington law, Vons's cross-complaint alleged that the franchisees failed to cook the meat properly because of deficiencies in the cooking and training procedures and equipment requirements provided for by Foodmaker on a system-wide basis.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>WRMI argues strenuously that there was no substantial nexus between its California contacts and Vons's negligent handling of the meat. Conceding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> that a defendant does not necessarily have to have had a prior relationship with the plaintiff in order for specific jurisdiction to be established, WRMI asserts that cases finding jurisdiction despite a lack of prior relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant turn upon a finding of a substantial nexus between the defendant's forum activities and the plaintiff's claim \u0097 a nexus that WRMI argues is missing in this case. In <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, for example, WRMI claims we found a substantial relationship because the accident arose out of the very activity that formed the essential basis of the defendant's contacts with California. Here, by contrast, WRMI contends \u0097 as does Seabest \u0097 that its improper cooking of hamburgers in Washington had nothing directly to do with its forum-based activities. Although it concedes that the franchise agreement gave Foodmaker the right to dictate WRMI's food preparation methods, WRMI argues this was of minimal significance. Rather, it contends, the benefit that WRMI bargained for when it entered into the agreement was not the privilege of having Foodmaker supervise it, but the benefit gained from association with a regionally known chain. Moreover, WRMI asserts that by entering into the agreement, it did not seek to conduct any business in California, did not own property in California, has no employees in California, and never has contracted or done business directly with Vons. Finally, WRMI claims Vons failed to demonstrate that Foodmaker actually directed Seabest or WRMI to use substandard training, equipment, and cooking methods.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. The relationship of Vons's claim to WRMI's forum activities is less attenuated than the relationship of the accident victim's claim to the defendant's forum activities in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>. We did not hold in that case that <i>only</i> an injury caused by the very activity that formed the defendant's forum contacts would give rise to specific jurisdiction. Indeed, under WRMI's reading of the case, a state never could exercise jurisdiction over a tort claim arising from a contractual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> contact. Such a result, however, would be inconsistent with the fairness rationale underlying specific jurisdiction, by which courts recognize that defendants who purposefully avail themselves of forum benefits may have to answer claims against them in the forum. Nor would it be consistent with Chief Judge Posner's analysis in <i>Amoco Cadiz, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">699 F.2d 909</span>, or with the other federal cases discussed above, which recognize that a tort claim arising out of a contractual relationship may be sufficiently connected to the forum contact to give rise to specific jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Further, WRMI's claim that it did no business in California and derived no economic benefit from this state is belied by the ongoing contractual relationship it entered into with Foodmaker, a relationship by which WRMI sought to secure to itself the benefits the California business could provide in terms of ready-made goodwill for WRMI's restaurants, as well as an easy-to-follow format for establishing and running these businesses. In any event, jurisdiction is not limited to litigation over bargained-for contract benefits when a tort claim is at stake. As in <i>Amoco Cadiz, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">699 F.2d 909</span>, in which the contractual activities in the state sufficed to establish specific jurisdiction even though they did not relate directly to the oil spill off the coast of France, subjecting defendants to jurisdiction is not unfair simply because the plaintiff's claim did not involve one of the specific benefits defendant anticipated would flow from doing business in the forum. Finally, it is obvious that Vons is not required to <i>prove</i> the allegations of its cross-complaint in order to establish that jurisdiction is proper in this forum. (<i>Edmunds</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. App.4th 221</span>, 228 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. Rptr.2d 281</span>].)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>(9) In opposition to the conclusion we reach, the Court of Appeal determined (and Seabest and WRMI argue) that the connection between the forum contacts of these cross-defendants and Vons's asserted claims against them fails to meet various tests of \"relatedness\" that they assert are required by the doctrine of specific jurisdiction. In addition, Vons urges us to adopt a more expansive test of \"relatedness\" than the one we have embraced. The various theories offered by the Court of Appeal and the parties are not persuasive, however, at least in the context of the type of ongoing franchise relationship that has been demonstrated in this case. We must recall that the United States Supreme Court has rejected the use of \"talismanic jurisdictional formulas\" (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 485 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 549]), stating that \"`the facts of each case must [always] be weighed' in determining whether personal jurisdiction would comport with `fair play and substantial justice.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 485-486 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> The Court of Appeal declared that it did not need to determine whether Seabest and WRMI had \"purposefully availed\" themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in this state, because even if they had, the causes of action against them did not \"arise out of\" or \"relate to\" those activities. The appellate court reached this conclusion because of its view that Seabest's and WRMI's contacts with California did not <i>cause</i> Vons's claim. The court believed it was required to apply an extremely narrow test of causation in deciding whether there was a sufficient connection between the activity and the cause of action. Under the test formulated by the Court of Appeal, unless the forum contact <i>proximately caused</i> the occurrence that injured the plaintiff, the connection between the contacts and the claim is insufficient to permit the exercise of specific jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal relied principally upon two cases in attempting to demonstrate the proper application of such a test. As will appear, we disapprove the reasoning of these cases to the extent they are inconsistent with this opinion. In the first case, <i>Circus Circus Hotels, Inc.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1981) <span class=\"citation no-link\">120 Cal. App.3d 546</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">174 Cal. Rptr. 885</span>] (<i>Circus Circus</i>), California residents brought a tort cause of action in this state against a Nevada hotel corporation. They sought damages for losses they incurred while on vacation in Nevada, alleging that the hotel's negligence was the cause of a burglary of their hotel room. They alleged that the Nevada hotel's substantial advertising campaign in California induced them to patronize the hotel. The reviewing court found the connection between the cause of action and the Nevada hotel's activities in California insufficient to warrant this state's exercise of jurisdiction. The court observed: \"It could not be seriously contended that the defendant's advertising was the <i>proximate cause</i> of the burglary....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 569, italics added.)</p>\n<p>As additional support, the Court of Appeal below relied upon <i>Sklar</i> v. <i>Princess Properties International, Ltd.</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. App.3d 1202</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">240 Cal. Rptr. 102</span>] (<i>Sklar</i>). In that case, the plaintiff, a California resident, filed a tort action in this state against a Bermuda hotel corporation, alleging personal injuries sustained in a fall at the hotel. The plaintiff alleged the hotel contracted through its agents for plaintiff's accommodations in a California transaction and engaged in advertising in California. The Court of Appeal found insufficient the connection between the activity alleged to have occurred in the forum state and plaintiff's cause of action. It said: \"It cannot seriously be contended that sale to plaintiff in California of accommodations at defendant's hotel in Bermuda was the <i>proximate cause</i> of plaintiff's personal injuries....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1208, italics added.)</p>\n<p>Applying the standard it derived from these cases, the Court of Appeal explained: \"In the present case, defendants' act or omission alleged to have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> caused damage to Vons and for which it seeks indemnification is the undercooking of hamburgers in the state of Washington. It cannot seriously be contended that but for defendants [<i>sic</i>] activities in California ... the hamburger patties would not have been undercooked in Washington.\" The Court of Appeal also emphasized that defendants had no relationship with Vons, and that, \"[i]n short, the causal link between defendants' ... franchise relationship with Foodmaker and the alleged failure to properly cook hamburgers in Washington is too attenuated to say the injury arose from the activities of Seabest and WRMI in this state.\" As is evident, although the Court of Appeal used the term \"but for\" in discussing whether an adequate relationship had been shown between the forum contacts and the plaintiff's claim, the test actually applied was a proximate cause test as used in <i>Circus Circus, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">120 Cal. App.3d 546</span>, and <i>Sklar, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. App.3d 1202</span>, whose focus is whether the forum contact was the legal cause of the plaintiff's injuries.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal's holding that jurisdiction cannot exist unless the alleged injury was proximately caused by the contacts in the forum state \u0097 in the sense that the contacts were the immediate preceding legal cause of plaintiff's injury \u0097 is untenable, at least in the franchise setting. To require that the injury be proximately caused by the forum contact is to require that the injury \"arise out of\" the forum contact in the strictest sense. Such a requirement is inconsistent with the formulation that appears in <i>Burger King</i> and <i>Helicopteros,</i> which, as noted above, states in the disjunctive that jurisdiction is proper when litigation results from alleged injuries that \"`arise out of <i>or relate to</i>'\" forum activities. (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541], italics added; <i>Helicopteros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">supra,</a></span></i> 466 U.S. at p. 414, fn. 9 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 411]; see also <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 U.S. at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at p. 104] [\"The exercise of that privilege [forum activities] may give rise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of <i>or are connected with</i> the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to be undue.\"].) Similarly, such a requirement is inconsistent with the relevant standard in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> 16 Cal.3d at page 148, wherein we stated, also in the disjunctive, that the proper inquiry is \"whether the cause of action arises out of <i>or has a substantial connection with</i> that [forum] activity.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>A proximate cause test as applied in the foregoing Court of Appeal cases would prohibit the exercise of specific jurisdiction in most contract actions arising out of ongoing interstate contractual relations \u0097 the sort of case in which specific jurisdiction is most obviously appropriate. This is so because the contractual relationship usually cannot be said to <i>cause</i> a party to fail to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> live up to the terms of the contract. If only an injury proximately caused by the forum contact could give rise to specific jurisdiction, the United States Supreme Court would have reached a different result in <i>Burger King, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, because the forum activity in that case (the ongoing contractual relationship in Florida) did not <i>cause</i> the injury (the franchisee's failure to make franchise payments in Michigan). Similarly, the Court of Appeal's formulation would have produced a different result in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, where the forum activities (deliveries inside California) did not <i>cause</i> the injury (the accident in Nevada).</p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court long ago rejected the notion that personal jurisdiction might turn upon mechanical tests such as a proximate cause test.

A person who purposefully avails himself or herself of the benefits of doing business in the forum state must be prepared to answer lawsuits that relate to his or her activity there. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 540-541].) The due process clause recognizes the individual's liberty interest in structuring his or her business relations so as to avoid jurisdiction in another forum (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">ibid.</a></span></i>; see also <i>World-Wide Volkswagen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110170\"><a href=\"/opinion/110170/world-wide-volkswagen-corp-v-woodson/\">supra,</a></span></i> 444 U.S. at p. 297 [62 L.Ed.2d at p. 501]), but a narrow proximate cause test of the relationship between the plaintiff's claim and the defendant's forum contacts is unnecessary to ensure that interest. Indeed, such a test would shield nonresidents who take advantage of forum benefits from the duty to answer related claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> in the forum for injury the nonresident defendant has caused. As the high court has declared, however, \"the Due Process Clause may not readily be wielded as a territorial shield to avoid interstate obligations that have been voluntarily assumed.\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 474 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541].)</p>\n<p>An individual who, in the forum, has entered into an ongoing contractual relationship of the nature described in <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, or shown in the present case, has chosen not to structure its business relations to avoid that forum's jurisdiction, but rather has chosen to affiliate with the forum, and reasonably must anticipate exposure to litigation in the forum beyond claims that are in a narrow sense proximately caused by forum activities. This is readily apparent, because the high court has established that it is not the <i>particular injury</i> in the forum state that must be foreseeable to the defendant, but rather \"`the foreseeability that is critical to the due process analysis ... is that the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 474 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 542].)</p>\n<p>Finally, the narrow proximate cause test as applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case has been criticized as improperly importing common law policies limiting tort liability into the entirely unrelated field of jurisdiction. (Rose, <i>Related Contacts and Personal Jurisdiction: The \"But For\" Test</i> (1994) 82 Cal.L.Rev. 1545, 1577 (<i>Related Contacts</i>).) Although it is used mechanically in jurisdiction cases, the test operates as an expression of policy in tort cases. As one commentator has observed: \"It is particularly difficult to regard proximate or `legal' causation as a true definition of relatedness because proximate causation usually reflects a policy-based legal filter on `but for' causation. As Dean Prosser wrote, `[t]he term \"proximate cause\" is applied by the courts to those more or less undefined considerations which limit liability even where the fact of causation is clearly established.'\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reject the proximate cause test applied by the Court of Appeal in this case, and by the courts in <i>Sklar, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. App.3d 1202</span>, and <i>Circus Circus, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">120 Cal. App.3d 546</span>, because it is inconsistent with the rationale underlying specific jurisdiction in the context of an ongoing franchise relationship.</p>\n<p>An alternative to the narrow proximate cause test employed by the Court of Appeal, and one that both Vons and WRMI may be understood to urge in support of their own conflicting conclusions, is an analysis focused upon whether a defendant's forum contacts are a \"but for\" cause of the plaintiff's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> claim. Although WRMI argues that Vons's claims fail this test, the test is a broad one that usually is understood as <i>supporting</i> expansive exercise of jurisdiction over nonresidents. (See, e.g., Rose, <i>Related Contacts, supra,</i> 82 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 1577; Note, <i>Specific Personal Jurisdiction and the \"Arise From or Relate to\" Requirement ... What Does it Mean?</i> (1993) 50 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1265, 1277 (<i>Note</i>).)</p>\n<p>For example, in <i>Dialysis at Sea, Inc.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 Cal. App.3d 788</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">265 Cal. Rptr. 71</span>] (<i>Dialysis at Sea</i>), a nonresident defendant contracted in California with California residents for special medical services aboard a cruise ship. Defendants provided negligent medical care on board ship outside of California, injuring the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal refused to apply the narrow proximate cause test of <i>Sklar, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. App.3d 1202</span>, and <i>Circus Circus, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">120 Cal. App.3d 546</span>. It observed that under such a test contractual relations formed in one state never could be the basis for jurisdiction over a related tort claim for injuries inflicted in another state. (<i>Dialysis at Sea, supra,</i> 216 Cal. App.3d at p. 795.) The appellate court also noted the absence of a \"direct connection\" between the forum activities in <i>Sklar, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 Cal. App.3d 1202</span>, and <i>Circus Circus, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">120 Cal. App.3d 546</span>, and the causes of action asserted therein. It observed, by contrast, that the contract for medical care on board ship in the case before it put the out-of-state defendant within \"striking distance\" of the plaintiff, allowing the defendant tortiously to injure the California plaintiff. The court declared that the contract was the \"but for\" cause of the injury, stating that \"[i]n other words, `but for' the contract plaintiff and the decedent would not have been on the cruise and the decedent would not have been subjected to [the defendant's] allegedly negligent medical treatment.\" (216 Cal. App.3d at p. 795; see also <i>State of Oregon</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. App.4th 1550</span> [applying same test to permit exercise of jurisdiction in California when Oregon university recruited California athlete in California, and medical malpractice in Oregon allegedly contributed to athlete's death].)<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Several federal court opinions also employ a \"but for\" test in this context. For example, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a Florida cruise line's solicitation of business in Washington State was related sufficiently to an injury on board the cruise ship in international waters to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction in Washington, because in the absence of the solicitation the plaintiffs would not have taken the cruise and the injury would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> not have occurred. (<i>Shute</i> v. <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> (9th Cir.1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">897 F.2d 377</span>, revd. on other grounds <i>sub nom. </i><i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> v. <i>Shute, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">499 U.S. 585</a></span>.) The appeals court found jurisdiction although the cruise line had no offices or exclusive agents in Washington, and was not registered to do business there, but merely advertised in the local media, mailed brochures and paid commissions to travel agents there, and conducted promotional seminars in the state. Only about 1 percent of the cruise line's sales took place in Washington.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared that a \"but for\" test is \"consistent with the basic function of the `arising out of' requirement \u0097 it preserves the essential distinction between general and specific jurisdiction,\" in that it \"preserves the requirement that there be <i>some</i> nexus between the cause of action and the defendant's activities in the forum.\" (<i>Shute</i> v. <i>Carnival Cruise Lines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">supra,</a></span></i> 897 F.2d at p. 385, italics added.) It rejected any narrower reading of the \"arising out of\" requirement as unnecessary to protect defendants from unreasonable assertions of jurisdiction, explaining that the third element of the specific jurisdiction analysis \u0097 that is, the reasonableness requirement \u0097 provides the necessary protection. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">Ibid.</a></span></i>) The court reasoned that any narrower application of the \"arising out of\" element would shield defendants who purposefully have availed themselves of forum benefits, and therefore would be \"an unwarranted departure from the core concepts of `fair play and substantial justice' which are central to the due process analysis\" underlying the exercise of specific jurisdiction. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 386.)</p>\n<p>Thereafter, in <i>Ballard</i> v. <i>Savage</i> (9th Cir.1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704025\"><a href=\"/opinion/704025/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7276-95-daily-journal-dar-12439-elizabeth/\">65 F.3d 1495</a></span>, 1500, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed <i>Shute</i> v. <i>Carnival Cruise Lines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">897 F.2d 377</span>, after the high court's reversal of the latter opinion on other grounds. (See <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> v. <i>Shute, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">499 U.S. 585</a></span>.) The Ninth Circuit found that a duped investor's fraud claim against an Austrian bank that was used as a repository for deposits in a Ponzi scheme was sufficiently related to the bank's general banking activities in the forum to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction, although the bank's general banking activities in the forum clearly did not cause the injury. The court found that the \"but for\" test was satisfied because, had the bank not done business in the United States, the creator of the Ponzi scheme would not have used it in connection with the fraudulent scheme. (<i>Ballard</i> v. <i>Savage, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704025\"><a href=\"/opinion/704025/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7276-95-daily-journal-dar-12439-elizabeth/\">supra,</a></span></i> 65 F.3d at p. 1500; see also <i>Prejean</i> v. <i>Sonatrach, Inc.</i> (5th Cir.1981) <span class=\"citation no-link\">652 F.2d 1260</span>, 1270, fn. 21 [\"Logically, there is no reason why a tort cannot grow out of a contractual contact. In a case like this, the contractual contact is a `but for' causative factor for the tort since it brought the parties within tortious `striking distance' of each other. While the relationship between a tort suit and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> contractual contact is certainly more tenuous than when a tort suit arises from a tort contact, that only goes to whether the contact is by itself sufficient for due process, not whether the suit arises from the contact.\"].)</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded it is productive to focus upon whether the injury would have occurred \"but for\" the forum contacts, at least when an ongoing franchise relationship is the forum contact. As applied in certain circumstances, this standard may be too lax and theoretically may include any historical cause of the plaintiff's injuries. For example, as Seabest notes, if the defendant is a lawyer who has received his or her legal education in the forum, that legal education may be said to be a \"but for\" cause of any malpractice the lawyer commits anywhere in the nation, yet it hardly seems a sufficient basis for the forum to exercise jurisdiction. One commentator has criticized the \"but for\" test as permitting a virtually unlimited exercise of jurisdiction. (Brilmayer, <i>Related Contacts and Personal Jurisdiction</i> (1988) 101 Harv. L.Rev. 1444, 1462 (<i>Related Contacts</i>); Brilmayer, <i>How Contacts Count, supra,</i> Sup. Ct. Rev. at p. 84.) As Professor Lea Brilmayer points out, one's birth is a historical \"but for\" cause of one's every action, yet the location of one's birth normally should not determine personal jurisdiction. (Brilmayer, <i>Related Contacts, supra,</i> 101 Harv. L.Rev. at p. 1462.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, as another commentator has pointed out, the concept of \"minimum contacts\" is not compatible with the elements of causation \u0097 normally physical factors \u0097 that are involved in tort claims. Just as with the proximate cause test, \"[a] further problem with the `but for' causation is its mismatch with the social activities that are part of the causal chain in typical personal jurisdiction disputes. In tort causal chains, one usually encounters physical phenomena such as a speeding car, a careless shotgun blast, or a baby food spill on a supermarket floor. Conversely, contacts in personal jurisdiction cases are generally social acts, like advertising directed at forum residents. In the latter instance, the causal link between those acts and the injuries necessarily passes through some conscious decision on the plaintiff's part,\" thereby interrupting the causal chain, though not necessarily making the exercise of jurisdiction unreasonable. (Rose, <i>Related Contacts, supra,</i> 82 Cal.L.Rev. at pp. 1571-1572.) Further, even in the context of \"but for\" causation in the tort field, it generally has been accepted that the search for \"but for\" causation is not a meaningful one when two or more concurrent, independent causes exist, because the tortfeasor does not escape liability for his or her negligence on the ground that the same harm would have occurred without such negligence. (<i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1453216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1453216/mitchell-v-gonzales/\">54 Cal.3d 1041</a></span>, 1049 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">1 Cal. Rptr.2d 913</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">819 P.2d 872</span>].) The same may be true in the context of jurisdiction, such that if a forum contact is but one of several concurrent, independent causes of plaintiff's injury, it nonetheless may be fair to permit the state to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> Significantly, the high court has not been concerned with causation in this context. Rather, it has spoken of a <i>relationship</i> between the cause of action and the contacts in the forum, and has used relatively broad terms to describe the necessary relationship. (See <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 U.S. at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at pp. 103-104]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, 472 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">85 L.Ed.2d 528</a></span>, 540-541]; <i>Helicopteros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\">supra,</a></span></i> 466 U.S. at p. 414, fn. 9 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 411].) In <i>International Shoe,</i> for example, the court found the defendant's sales activities within the state were such as to subject it to the forum's jurisdiction, without requiring proof that the sales activities caused the events underlying the claim within the state (a claim for unemployment insurance contribution for the sales representatives).<sup>[9]</sup> (<i>International Shoe, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>.) In <i>Burger King,</i> too, as we have pointed out, the Michigan defendant's breach of contract was not <i>caused</i> by his contacts with the Florida corporation, even though the claim certainly arose out of the contract. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>.) And in <i>Cornelison,</i> we found a Nevada trucking company's history of contacts with California sufficient to establish jurisdiction, although these contacts did not literally <i>cause</i> the accident in Nevada that was the subject of the lawsuit. (<i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>.) The foregoing authorities call into question the utility of importing a causation test from tort law into the area of jurisdiction in order to evaluate a matter that fundamentally is one of relationship and fairness, rather than causation.</p>\n<p>Again, beginning with <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>, the high court has cautioned repeatedly that the question whether a nonresident defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum, so as to make fair the exercise of jurisdiction, cannot be answered by resort to mechanical tests. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at pp. 103-104]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 478 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 544-545]; <i>Kulko</i> v. <i>California Superior Court, supra,</i> 436 U.S. at pp. 91, 92 [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 140-141]; <i>Shaffer</i> v. <i>Heitner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">433 U.S. 186</a></span>, 204 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">53 L.Ed.2d 683</a></span>, 697-698].) We echoed this concern in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>, stating that specific jurisdiction does not turn upon any precise formula. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 150; see also <i>Edmunds</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 24 Cal. App.4th at pp. 230-231; <i>Pennsylvania Health &amp; Life Ins. Guaranty Assn.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal. App.4th 477</span>, 481 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">27 Cal. Rptr.2d 507</span>].) The question whether the facts are sufficient to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction is answered fundamentally by considering the goal of fairness. A \"but for\" test is overly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> mechanical and fails to concentrate on the central issue presented by a motion to quash for lack of specific jurisdiction \u0097 that is, whether the defendant's forum contacts and the plaintiff's claim are related sufficiently so that it is <i>fair</i> to subject the defendant to jurisdiction in the forum.</p>\n<p>Seabest urges alternatively that we declare that the relationship required between the forum contact and the plaintiff's claim must be direct and concrete. It appears Seabest would have us limit the forum to exercising jurisdiction over nonresident defendants for, in Seabest's words, \"alleged wrongdoing that took place in the forum.\" Specifically, Seabest urges that we adopt the view championed by Professor Brilmayer, that specific jurisdiction is legitimate under recent high court authority only when a forum contact is <i>substantively related</i> to the plaintiff's cause of action \u0097 that is, when conduct constituting a forum contact that took place <i>in</i> the forum normally would be pleaded under state substantive law applicable to the plaintiff's cause of action. (See Brilmayer, <i>How Contacts Count, supra,</i> 1980 Sup. Ct. Rev. at p. 82; Brilmayer et al., <i>A General Look at General Jurisdiction</i> (1988) 66 Tex. L.Rev. 721, 738 (<i>General Jurisdiction</i>).) If a fact alleged to be a forum contact would be irrelevant in a domestic dispute, the argument continues, it is not a \"related\" contact merely because a nonresident defendant is involved. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>In support of this thesis, Professor Brilmayer asserts that the constitutional underpinning for specific jurisdiction is the state's sovereign power to regulate conduct <i>within</i> the state. (Brilmayer et al., <i>General Jurisdiction, supra,</i> 66 Tex. L.Rev. at pp. 739, 740; Brilmayer, <i>How Contacts Count, supra,</i> Sup. Ct. Rev. at pp. 85-86 [arguing that the concept of state sovereignty permits exercise of jurisdiction over nonresidents because of the \"State's right to regulate activities occurring within the State\"].) She explains: \"A test of <i>substantive relevance</i> helps to identify those situations in which the state is using the litigation to regulate local activity. Conduct that has no legal relevance [to the claim] is unlikely to give rise to any plausible state interest in regulation. Consequently, if such legally irrelevant conduct is the only local contact, then a state cannot predicate jurisdiction upon any purported desire to regulate local activities.\" (Brilmayer et al., <i>supra,</i> 66 Tex. L.Rev at p. 740, italics added.)</p>\n<p>Seabest argues that the \"substantive relevance\" standard now represents the majority view in the federal circuits. Our research, however, shows otherwise. In the First Circuit Court of Appeals, the court expressly has repudiated the claim that its earlier decisions adopted the substantive relevance doctrine as a matter of federal constitutional law. (<i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alioto</i> (1st Cir.1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\">26 F.3d 201</a></span>, 207, fn. 8.) While the cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> from the First Circuit Court of Appeals cited by Seabest express various standards,<sup>[10]</sup> we observe that in a case decided after those cited by Seabest, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has approved the exercise of jurisdiction when forum contacts were not substantively related to the plaintiff's claim. (<i>Nowak</i> v. <i>Tak How Investments, Ltd.</i> (1st Cir.1996) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725496\"><a href=\"/opinion/725496/ralph-m-nowak-administrator-of-the-estate-of-sally-ann-nowak-v-tak-how/\">94 F.3d 708</a></span>.) In that case, plaintiff's decedent drowned in a swimming pool in the defendant's Hong Kong hotel. The court determined that the Hong Kong hotel corporation's solicitation of the patronage of Massachusetts residents and its negotiations conducted by fax over the terms of a group rate contract established a sufficient relationship between the forum contacts and the plaintiff's claim to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction in Massachusetts, although the plaintiff's injury occurred in Hong Kong. It appears evident as well that the solicitation was not substantively related to the plaintiff's claim. The court also observed that although it favors a proximate cause standard of relatedness, it also recognizes that such a test is unduly restrictive in some cases. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 715.) The court concluded that although jurisdiction necessarily is reasonable if premised upon a forum \"contact that is a legal cause of the injury underlying the controversy \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> that `form[s] an \"important or [at least] material, element of proof\" in the plaintiff's case' [citation]\" \u0097 jurisdiction nevertheless may be exercised appropriately in cases <i>not</i> meeting this standard. (<i>Ibid.</i>) The court declared: \"If the resident is harmed while engaged in activities integral to the relationship the corporation sought to establish, we think the nexus between the contacts and the cause of action is sufficiently strong to survive the due process inquiry at least at the relatedness stage.\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 715-716; see also <i>Pritsker</i> v. <i>Yari</i> (1st Cir.1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\">42 F.3d 53</a></span>, 61 [relatedness element a \"flexible, relaxed standard\"]; <i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alioto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\">26 F.3d 201</a></span>, 205-206, 207, fn. 8 [indicating standard should be flexible].)</p>\n<p>Seabest also cites cases from the Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeals in support of its position. (See, e.g., <i>Gelfand</i> v. <i>Tanner Motor Tours, Ltd.</i> (2d Cir.1964) <span class=\"citation no-link\">339 F.2d 317</span>, 321-322 [declining to exercise jurisdiction based upon in-state sale of bus tickets, because the alleged negligence took place entirely outside the forum]; <i>City of Virginia</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> <i>Beach</i> v. <i>Roanoke River Basin</i> (4th Cir.1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">776 F.2d 484</span>, 487 [noting that \"the activities that support the jurisdictional claim must coincide with those that form the basis of the plaintiff's substantive claim\"]; <i>Saylor</i> v. <i>Dyniewski</i> (7th Cir.1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">836 F.2d 341</span>, 343 [holding \"the case law plainly establishes that claims can only `arise from' transactions if some connection exists between the nature of the claim and the nature of the transaction,\" but specifically limiting this part of the holding to interpretation of Illinois's long-arm statute]; <i>Pearrow</i> v. <i>National Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co.</i> (8th Cir.1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">703 F.2d 1067</span>, 1068-1069 [interpreting only Arkansas's long-arm statute, the defendant's out-of-state negligence did not \"arise out of\" the defendant's in-state solicitation].) Only the first two cases cited actually support Seabest's claim, the others being interpretations of state long-arm statutes. As our review demonstrates, these authorities do not demonstrate that Seabest's test represents any \"majority view\" among the federal circuits.</p>\n<p>Neither is Seabest's reliance upon <i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105728\"><a href=\"/opinion/105728/hanson-v-denckla/\">357 U.S. 235</a></span>, as an \"illustration\" of the substantive relevance test particularly enlightening. In <i>Hanson,</i> legatees sought to establish personal jurisdiction over a Delaware trustee in a Florida court. The trust had been created in Delaware, and the beneficiary thereafter moved to Florida and there exercised her powers of appointment. The argument in support of Florida's exercise of jurisdiction was that the trustee had established sufficient \"affiliation\" with Florida to justify jurisdiction. The high court rejected this argument, finding insufficient minimum contacts between the Delaware trustee and the state of Florida. It explained that the trustee had no office in Florida and neither transacted nor solicited business there, and that the trust assets never had been held or administered in Florida. (P. 251 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 1296].) In addition, the court explained that \"[t]he cause of action in this case is not one that arises out of an act done or transaction consummated in the forum State.\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105728\"><a href=\"/opinion/105728/hanson-v-denckla/\">Ibid.</a></span></i>) Seabest seizes on this statement as an example of its \"substantive relevance\" test. Its reliance is misplaced. In making this statement, the court was concerned not with establishing a general rule of relatedness for the purpose of specific jurisdiction, but with distinguishing the case at bar from <i>McGee</i> v. <i>International Life Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105595\"><a href=\"/opinion/105595/mcgee-v-international-life-ins-co/\">355 U.S. 220</a></span>. In the latter case, the court held that a single forum contact in the form of an insurance contract could be the basis for jurisdiction, in light of the forum state's interest in providing effective redress when insurers that have solicited business in the state fail to pay claims. (<i>McGee</i> v. <i>International Life Ins. Co., supra,</i> 355 U.S. at p. 223 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 226]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 475, fn. 18 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543].) In <i>Hanson,</i> by contrast, the court stated that the contract that was the subject of the litigation had no connection with the forum state and therefore <i>could not count as a forum \"contact\"</i> on the part of the trustee. (<i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105728\"><a href=\"/opinion/105728/hanson-v-denckla/\">supra,</a></span></i> 357 U.S. at p. 252 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 1297].)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> Consequently, the court reasoned, \"this suit cannot be said to be one to enforce an obligation that arose from a privilege the defendant [trustee] exercised in Florida.\" (<i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105728\"><a href=\"/opinion/105728/hanson-v-denckla/\">supra,</a></span></i> 357 U.S. at p. 252 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 1297].) This language does not suggest that specific jurisdiction is legitimate only when a forum contact is substantively related to the plaintiff's cause of action \u0097 that is, when conduct constituting a forum contact normally would be pleaded under state substantive law applicable to the plaintiff's cause of action. Although the court in <i>Hanson</i> certainly found that when no relationship exists between the subject of the litigation and the forum, and there are no other contacts between the defendant and the forum, the exercise of jurisdiction is inappropriate, the court was not presented with the different question of how connected a cause of action must be to forum contacts in order to establish specific jurisdiction.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Seabest also urges the following policy rationales in support of the substantive relevance standard. It contends the test would prevent the assertion of jurisdiction based upon attenuated contacts that have no direct relationship to a lawsuit. We are not persuaded. Existing law regarding specific jurisdiction, with its emphasis upon \"purposeful availment,\" already prohibits the exercise of jurisdiction on the basis of attenuated contacts. The assertion that the standard should ensure a direct relationship between the contacts and the lawsuit is simply another way of stating the standard promoted by Seabest, but does not advance a supporting argument.</p>\n<p>Seabest also argues that the policy of long-arm statutes (and, presumably, the due process clause) is to permit states to regulate activities that take place within their borders, and that its proposed rule comports with this asserted policy. According to Seabest, the interest of the state in regulating activity within its borders is implicated only when the plaintiff seeks to impose liability for some act that the defendant actually committed in the forum state. This rationale is stated more fully in the works of Professor Brilmayer, cited above.</p>\n<p>We reject this argument, however, because in our view it fails to acknowledge another interest of the state that is recognized as an incident of state sovereignty. Specifically, not only does the state have the power as sovereign to regulate conduct through the application of its substantive law, but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> the state additionally has an interest in providing a judicial forum for its residents \u0097 so long as the goal of fairness to defendants also is observed. As the high court stated in <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, explaining why a state legitimately may exercise specific jurisdiction: \"A State generally has a `manifest interest' in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 473 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 541], citing <i>McGee</i> v. <i>International Life Ins. Co., supra,</i> 355 U.S. at pp. 222-223 [2 L.Ed.2d at pp. 225-226]; see also <i>id.</i> at pp. 223-224 [2 L.Ed.2d at pp. 226-227]; and <i>Keeton</i> v. <i>Hustler Magazine, Inc., supra,</i> 465 U.S. at p. 776 [79 L.Ed.2d at pp. 798-799]; see also <i>Rush</i> v. <i>Savchuk</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110171\"><a href=\"/opinion/110171/rush-v-savchuk/\">444 U.S. 320</a></span>, 329, 323 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110171\"><a href=\"/opinion/110171/rush-v-savchuk/\">62 L.Ed.2d 516</a></span>, 525-526, 522, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110171\"><a href=\"/opinion/110171/rush-v-savchuk/\">100 S.Ct. 571</a></span>] [acknowledging state's interest in providing forum to resident, but holding such interest insufficient to justify jurisdiction when cause of action arose outside forum and the defendant's single forum contact would not render foreseeable the possibility of jurisdiction in that forum]; <i>Dunne</i> v. <i>State of Florida</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">6 Cal. App.4th 1340</span>, 1346 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">8 Cal. Rptr.2d 483</span>].) This interest cannot be satisfied consistently with fairness to the defendant when the defendant has no minimum contacts with the state \u0097 but when the defendant does have such contacts with the state, it can be satisfied.</p>\n<p>In short, the theoretical basis proffered for the substantive relevance standard is unpersuasive. The high court never has indicated that the state's sovereign power to regulate conduct within its borders is the sole justification for a state's exercise of specific jurisdiction. Rather, it has treated the question whether the state may assert power to regulate conduct in a particular case through its substantive law as distinct from the question whether minimum contacts have been established for the purpose of the state court's assertion of jurisdiction. (See <i>Keeton</i> v. <i>Hustler Magazine, Inc., supra,</i> 465 U.S. at p. 778 [79 L.Ed.2d at pp. 799-800]; see also <i>Kulko</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 436 U.S. at p. 98 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 145]; <i>Shaffer</i> v. <i>Heitner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109721\"><a href=\"/opinion/109721/shaffer-v-heitner/\">supra,</a></span></i> 433 U.S. at p. 215 [53 L.Ed.2d at pp. 704-705]; Twitchell, <i>The Myth of General Jurisdiction</i> (1988) 101 Harv. L.Rev. 610, 654-655; Korn, <i>The Choice-of-Law Revolution: A Critique</i> (1983) 83 Colum. L.Rev. 772, 786-787.) Indeed, the high court has made it clear that a state's jurisdiction to provide a forum is <i>not limited</i> to claims that involve conduct that took place within the state's borders. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 476 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543]; see 1 Casad, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 2.05, p. 2-99.) Rather, as noted, the state has a legitimate interest as sovereign in providing its residents with protection from injuries caused by nonresidents and with a forum in which to seek redress. This assertion of sovereignty with respect to nonresident defendants is fair when those defendants have availed themselves of certain benefits within the state and the claim is related to those contacts. The relatedness requirement is imposed in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> order to ensure fairness to defendants who have relatively attenuated contacts with the state, and not to reflect that the state's sovereign power is limited to adjudicating claims that arise within its borders.</p>\n<p>Especially inappropriate is Seabest's suggestion that the state may not provide a forum in a case in which the nonresident has taken advantage of the state's market or laws and in the process injured a forum resident. As already pointed out in connection with the proximate cause test applied by the Court of Appeal, a restrictive test of relatedness is inconsistent with the fairness rationale that informs the specific jurisdiction analysis. That is, a person who purposefully takes advantage of the benefits of doing business in the forum state fairly can be required to answer lawsuits that relate to his or her activities there (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 472 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 540-541]); such an exercise of jurisdiction does not offend \"`traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\" (<i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> 326 U.S. at p. 316 [90 L.Ed. at p. 102].) As the high court has admonished: \"[T]o the extent that a [defendant] exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state. The exercise of that privilege may give rise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the [defendant] to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to be undue.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at p. 104].) The substantive relevance test would make jurisdiction turn upon pleading requirements under state substantive law, a focus that falls far from the real issue of evaluating jurisdiction in terms of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p>We also note that the substantive relevance test proposed by Seabest would have produced a different outcome in <i>Cornelison, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 143</span>. In that case, the defendant's forum activities (making deliveries in California) presumably would not have been relevant in the wrongful death action based upon a claim that the defendant negligently drove his truck, thereby causing the accident in Nevada. Nonetheless, we were of the view that California could, consistently with \"fair play and substantial justice,\" exercise specific jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p>Seabest argues finally that the substantive relevance test provides a bright line rule and affords the simplest guideline for courts to follow. Academic commentators have noted the same attraction in this test. (See <i>Note, supra,</i> 50 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. at p. 1290; Rose, <i>Related Contacts, supra,</i> 82 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 1579; Twitchell, <i>The Myth of General Jurisdiction, supra,</i> 101 Harv. L.Rev. at p. 653.) Simple rules, however, are not always correct rules. A rule that essentially limits the jurisdiction of a forum to acts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> occurring within its boundaries may be easy to apply, but it is overly mechanical and is inconsistent with the thrust of recent high court opinions. It is inconsistent not only with express language in <i>Burger King, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">471 U.S. 462</a></span>, acknowledging the power of the state to exercise jurisdiction over out-of-state conduct that injures a forum resident, but also is inconsistent with the direction followed by the court ever since it explained in <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>, that \"the criteria by which we mark the boundary line between those activities which justify the subjection of a [defendant] to suit, and those which do not, cannot be simply mechanical or quantitative.... Whether due process is satisfied must depend ... upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 319 [90 L.Ed. at pp. 103-104].) In <i>World-Wide Volkswagen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110170\"><a href=\"/opinion/110170/world-wide-volkswagen-corp-v-woodson/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110170\"><a href=\"/opinion/110170/world-wide-volkswagen-corp-v-woodson/\">444 U.S. 286</a></span>, and <i>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\">480 U.S. 102</a></span>, for example, involving negligently designed products placed in the stream of commerce at the forum, the proposed test easily would have produced a holding that, because any negligence or design defect occurred outside the forum and no forum contact would have been pleaded in a domestic complaint raising the same claim, the forum could not exercise jurisdiction over the defendant manufacturers or distributors. Yet the United States Supreme Court instead undertook the traditional three-part analysis of jurisdiction outlined in its earlier cases. There is no indication the substantive relevance test would find favor in the high court.</p>\n<p>In the context of ongoing franchise relationships, we have rejected the proximate cause test as too narrow, and the \"but for\" test as too broad and amorphous. Finally, we conclude that the substantive relevance test is inappropriate, based as it is upon an overly restrictive view of the interest of the state in providing a judicial forum and redress to its residents. In sum, one must question the utility of importing a causation test from tort law to measure a matter that is fundamentally one of relationship and fairness rather than causation, keeping in mind that mechanical tests are inconsistent with a court's basic task of determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would comport with \"`fair play and substantial justice.'\" (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 486 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].) As the high court explained: \"This approach does, of course, preclude clear-cut jurisdictional rules. But any inquiry into `fair play and substantial justice' necessarily requires determinations `in which few answers will be written \"in black and white. The greys are dominant and even among them the shades are innumerable.\"'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 486, fn. 29 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>(10a) Having determined that defendants did establish minimum contacts with California, we finally must consider whether the assertion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> specific jurisdiction is fair. (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 476 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 543].) (11) In this connection, a court \"must consider the burden on the defendant, the interests of the forum State, and the plaintiff's interest in obtaining relief. It must also weigh in its determination `the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.'\" (<i>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 480 U.S. at p. 113 [94 L.Ed. at p. 105]; see also <i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 477 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 543-544].) (10b) Because we conclude defendants had the requisite minimum contacts with California, the burden is now on them to \"present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.\" (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at p. 477 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 544].)</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal did not reach this part of the analysis, having concluded the claim lacked a sufficient relationship to the cross-defendants' California contacts. Because we are as equipped as the Court of Appeal to analyze this point, we decide it here rather than remanding the matter to the intermediate court.</p>\n<p>WRMI asks us to consider that it had \"virtually no contact\" with California, that all the conduct that is the basis for Vons's claim occurred in Washington, that witnesses from Washington (mostly young persons formerly employed in its restaurants) would be forced to travel to California, and that WRMI is a small corporation that would be unduly burdened by being forced to defend itself in an extensive multiparty lawsuit far from home. WRMI also points out that it would be at a disadvantage at this point in time, because the litigation has continued during review of the order on its motion to quash.</p>\n<p>Seabest asks that we consider the allegedly tenuous and minimal nature of its contacts with California and the irrelevance of those contacts to Vons's claims against Seabest, the availability of the Washington forum to adjudicate not only Vons's cross-complaint, but the entire action, and the circumstance that a majority of the evidence relevant to Vons's claim will be in Washington. Seabest also urges that because it has no corporate presence in California, an undue burden would be imposed were it required to litigate in this state. It claims that Washington law should be applied, because Vons's claim turns on assertions that Seabest's cooking practices violated Washington law. Seabest also notes that some cases consider the extent to which the plaintiff's choice of forum appears to be the result of forum shopping, and suggests that Vons may have chosen the California forum in order to secure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> punitive damages that would be unavailable under Washington law. Seabest would discount California's interest in providing a forum for its residents, because Vons is a sophisticated litigant that can secure relief in any forum. Finally, Seabest argues California has no interest in regulating the conduct involved in the litigation, because all of the relevant conduct took place outside its borders.</p>\n<p>We have concluded that Seabest and WRMI had significant contacts with California through their ongoing business relationship with Foodmaker, and that the litigation bears a substantial connection to that forum relationship. We are not persuaded it would be unfair to subject Seabest and WRMI to the jurisdiction of the California courts.</p>\n<p>As the high court has explained, \"When minimum contacts have been established, often the interests of the plaintiff and the forum in the exercise of jurisdiction will justify even the serious burdens placed on the ... defendant.\" (<i>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 480 U.S. at p. 114 [94 L.Ed.2d at pp. 105-106].) Vons is a corporation, with headquarters in California, that not only alleged injury arising from Seabest's and WRMI's conduct, but that has been sued in the California forum in complex multiparty litigation as to which Seabest and WRMI may have a degree of concurrent liability. California has an obvious and direct interest in protecting Vons from injury and providing it with a forum in which its claims for relief may be adjudicated, enabling it to obtain the relief to which it is entitled. Moreover, considerations of judicial efficiency overwhelmingly favor litigation of all claims in a single forum. Because California already has invested judicial resources in this litigation apart from its substantive interest in the claims, the additional interest of efficiency favors this state's exercise of jurisdiction. Finally, although the burdens on defendants are not inconsiderable, they are not such \"as to make litigation `so gravely difficult and inconvenient'\" that Seabest and WRMI would be at a \"`severe disadvantage'\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 478 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 544]) in comparison to Vons, not the least because Foodmaker's agreement to provide a defense and indemnify Seabest and WRMI substantially mitigates those burdens.</p>\n<p>With respect to Seabest's arguments regarding the substantive law to be applied, the United States Supreme Court has explained that such concerns \"usually may be accommodated through means short of finding jurisdiction unconstitutional. For example, the potential clash of the forum's law with the `fundamental substantive social policies' of another State may be accommodated through application of the forum's choice-of-law rules.\" (<i>Burger King, supra,</i> 471 U.S. at p. 477 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 544], fn. omitted.) And, as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> in <i>Burger King,</i> where the defendant claimed Michigan's franchise laws governed many aspects of the franchise relationship, the acknowledged interest of Washington in applying its own law does not render California's interest null, or \u0097 more importantly \u0097 unconstitutional. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 483 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 547-548].) As for the claimed disparity in economic power and sophistication between Seabest and WRMI on the one hand, and Vons on the other, to the extent such a disparity is relevant, whatever disparity exists is mitigated, again, by Foodmaker's agreement to provide a defense to the extent one is not provided by Seabest's and WRMI's insurers.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude Seabest and WRMI have failed to demonstrate that exercise of jurisdiction by the California courts in this matter would be fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>Appellant's petition for a rehearing was denied February 5, 1997.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For convenience, references to \"the cross-complaint\" refer to Vons's cross-complaint.</p>\n<p>[2]  Seabest and WRMI are Washington corporations to which individual franchisees of Foodmaker assigned their franchise agreements. All restaurant locations involved in the franchise agreements were located in Washington State. The individual franchisees served as corporate directors of Seabest and WRMI, and it does not appear there were any shareholders other than the individual franchisees. The assignments provided the individual franchisees would remain obligated to perform on the franchise agreements. Foodmaker does not permit franchises to be sold directly to corporations. For convenience, we refer to Seabest and WRMI as the franchisees.</p>\n<p>[3]  Vons requests that we take judicial notice, augment the record, or make a factual determination under Code of Civil Procedure section 909, so that the record in these proceedings will include deposition testimony given after the judgment was rendered in this matter, as well as manuals referred to in the franchise agreement but not presented to the trial court, in order to demonstrate that the franchise agreement required Seabest and WRMI to follow certain specifications in cooking its hamburgers. Vons seeks to include this new evidence in order to rebut the factual claims of Seabest and WRMI that the franchise agreements did not dictate how the franchisees were to prepare hamburgers at their restaurants. Seabest and WRMI oppose the motion.\n</p>\n<p>Augmentation does not function to supplement the record with materials not before the trial court. (<i>People</i> v. <i>Brooks</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Cal.3d 471</span>, 484 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">162 Cal. Rptr. 177</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">605 P.2d 1306</span>]; <i>Rebney</i> v. <i>Wells Fargo Bank</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">220 Cal.

Practice Guide: Civil Appeals &amp; Writs 1 (The Rutter Group 1995) \u00b6 5:134, p. 5-32.) Reviewing courts generally do not take judicial notice of evidence not presented to the trial court. Rather, normally \"when reviewing the correctness of a trial court's judgment, an appellate court will consider only matters which were part of the record at the time the judgment was entered.\" (<i>Reserve Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Pisciotta</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation no-link\">30 Cal.3d 800</span>, 813 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">180 Cal. Rptr. 628</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">640 P.2d 764</span>].) No exceptional circumstances exist that would justify deviating from that rule, either by taking judicial notice or exercising the power to take evidence under Code of Civil Procedure section 909. (Cf. <i>Reserve Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Pisciotta, supra,</i> 30 Cal.3d at p. 813; <i>In re Conservatorship of Hart</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 Cal. App.3d 1244</span>, 1257 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">279 Cal. Rptr. 249</span>]; <i>Monsan Homes, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pogrebneak</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">210 Cal.

App.3d 858</span>, 863, fn. 3 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">206 Cal. Rptr. 28</span>].) The request is denied.</p>\n<p>[4]  The high court has declined to clarify the relatedness element of specific jurisdiction. (See, e.g., <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> v. <i>Shute</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">499 U.S. 585</a></span>, 589 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">113 L.Ed.2d 622</a></span>, 629, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\">111 S.Ct. 1522</a></span>] [declining to reach the issue whether a cruise company's contacts in Washington state were sufficiently connected to a slip and fall injury that occurred on board a ship, when the vessel was located outside the forum, to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction; the court decided the case on a narrower forum selection clause in the contract]; <i>Helicopteros, supra,</i> 466 U.S. at p. 415, fn. 10 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 411] [because the parties did not argue the issue, the majority in <i>Helicopteros</i> did not reach the question whether \"a forum's exercise of personal jurisdiction in a situation where the cause of action `relates to,' but does not `arise out of,' the defendant's contacts with the forum should be analyzed as an assertion of specific jurisdiction\"]; but see <i>id.</i> at p. 425 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 418] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.) [asserting that although the claim did not arise out of forum activities, it was related to those activities, which were relevant to establish specific jurisdiction].)</p>\n<p>[5]  Of course, it is not settled that California law would apply with respect to the claim for indemnification, because the choice-of-law decision has yet to be made.</p>\n<p>[6]  WRMI's claim that Vons first raised in this court the theory that the franchise agreement actually caused the injuries is not supported by the record. WRMI's contention that the manual directing franchisees as to required cooking procedures is not part of the record, and hence that Vons cannot prove the procedures were inadequate systemwide, appears to be directed to the merits of Vons's substantive claim, rather than to the jurisdictional question. It is the latter question, of course, that is before us.</p>\n<p>[7]  To the extent Seabest also may be understood to argue that the contacts of the individual franchisees before its incorporation cannot be attributed to it, the argument is questionable. It is generally true that the defendant's own contacts are considered for the purpose of jurisdiction (<i>Burger King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\">supra,</a></span></i> 471 U.S. at pp. 474-475 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 541-542]; <i>Sibley</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 442</span>, 447-448 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">128 Cal. Rptr. 34</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">546 P.2d 322</span>]), but corporate veils may be pierced and agents' activities may be considered in appropriate cases. (See, e.g., <i>Calder</i> v. <i>Jones</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">465 U.S. 783</span>, 789-790 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">79 L.Ed.2d 804</span>, 812-813, <span class=\"citation no-link\">104 S.Ct. 1482</span>]; <i>Seagate Technology</i> v. <i>A.J. Kgoyo Co.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 Cal. App.3d 696</span>, 701-702 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">268 Cal. Rptr. 586</span>]; <i>Wisconsin Elec. Mfg.

In Seabest's case, the corporate owners were identical to the individual franchisees (except that one individual had died), and indeed the individuals remained liable on the franchise agreement. (See 1 Casad, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 4.03[5] [d], p. 4-140 [court may impute contacts of corporation's predecessor if successor liable for obligations of predecessor].) In any event, in finding the requisite contacts, we rely only upon contacts that occurred after the incorporation, and upon the franchise agreement itself, by which Seabest obviously was bound.</p>\n<p>[8]  As will appear, we are not persuaded that the \"but for\" test provides an appropriate general standard, and consequently the reasoning of <i>Dialysis at Sea, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 Cal. App.3d 788</span>, and <i>State of Oregon</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. App.4th 1550</span>, is disapproved to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>[9]  Although the court in <i>International Shoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">supra,</a></span></i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\">326 U.S. 310</a></span>, did not use the specific/general jurisdiction nomenclature, the case has been understood as establishing the theoretical basis for specific jurisdiction. (Von Mehren &amp; Trautman, <i>Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis</i> (1966) 79 Harv. L.Rev. 1121, 1141-1163; Rose, <i>Related Contacts, supra,</i> 82 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 1550.)</p>\n<p>[10]  See, e.g., <i>United Elec. Workers</i> v. <i>163 Pleasant Street Corp.</i> (1st Cir.1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">960 F.2d 1080</span>, 1089 (forum contacts must be both cause in fact and legal cause of plaintiff's injury in order to support specific jurisdiction and \"the defendant's in-state conduct must form an `important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in the plaintiff's case\"); <i>Sawtelle</i> v. <i>Farrell</i> (1st Cir.1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709024\"><a href=\"/opinion/709024/arthur-f-sawtelle-etc-v-george-e-farrell/\">70 F.3d 1381</a></span>, 1389-1390 (suggesting that in a tort claim, the contacts must constitute the negligent conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury); see also <i>Marino</i> v. <i>Hyatt Corp.</i> (1st Cir.1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">793 F.2d 427</span>, 430 (no jurisdiction because in-state conduct \"would hardly be an important, or perhaps even a material, element of proof\" in the cause of action); but see <i>Fournier</i> v. <i>Best Western Treasure Island Resort</i> (1st Cir.1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">962 F.2d 126</span>, 127, in which the court simply asks whether plaintiff's injuries \"arise out of\" defendant's in-state conduct.</p>\n<p>[11]  Seabest's reliance upon <i>Farris</i> v. <i>Capt. J.B. Fronapfel Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">182 Cal. App.3d 982</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">227 Cal. Rptr. 619</span>], in support of the substantive relevance test, also is unpersuasive. In that case, the Court of Appeal found no contacts between the defendant (a Florida ship inspector) and California, and no relationship between the plaintiff's fraud claim and this state. The court did not suggest that, even if the defendant purposefully had availed himself of benefits in California, jurisdiction over him would be improper unless the lawsuit alleged that defendant's in-forum contacts were substantively related to the claim.</p>\n\n</div>",

We are asked to decide three issues: (1) whether causes of action based on collective liability, in which a given defendant need not have supplied the harmful product, come within the policies' \"products hazard\" coverage; (2) whether such causes fall within the general operations coverage; and (3) whether the personal injury coverage applies to certain other claims alleging interference with property rights and related matters.</p>\n<p>We conclude that all the underlying claims, if covered at all, are embraced within the \"products hazard\" coverage, which has either been exhausted or rendered inapplicable by means of an asbestos exclusion. Further, the general operations and personal injury provisions do not apply to the underlying claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Litigation Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>From 1928 until 1972 Fibreboard manufactured and sold products containing the mineral asbestos. During the past decade more than 150 claims have been asserted against Fibreboard and other manufacturers of asbestos products by school districts, municipalities, other government entities and private building owners, alleging damages and injury because of the presence of defendants' asbestos products in their buildings. Those claims now number 42.</p>\n<p>Typically, plaintiffs advance theories of negligence, strict liability, nuisance, breach of warranties, misrepresentation, enterprise liability, market share liability, concert of action and civil conspiracy. Typically, they seek damages related to the costs of inspection, containment, removal, replacement, relocation and other corrective action regarding asbestos products in these buildings, as well as punitive damages.</p>\n<p>From 1973 through 1986 Hartford was the primary general liability insurer for Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Fibreboard's parent. Louisiana-Pacific acquired Fibreboard in 1978 and added the subsidiary to its then-current Hartford policy by amendatory endorsement effective October 1, 1978.</p>\n<p>Hartford and Fibreboard first became embroiled in litigation over insurance coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims shortly after Fibreboard became an insured under Louisiana-Pacific's policies. In 1985 the parties, together with other asbestos producers and insurers entered into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*498</span> comprehensive settlement agreement (the Wellington Agreement) designed to resolve all issues pertaining to insurance coverage for these suits.</p>\n<p>Later, in 1985, after the Wellington Agreement had been signed, Fibreboard filed this declaratory relief action against numerous insurance companies, including Hartford, to resolve coverage issues pertinent to the asbestos-in-buildings claims. Fibreboard, through its attorney, represented that at that time the company was not seeking contribution from Hartford and had \"no intention\" of serving Hartford with the complaint.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1988, pursuant to the \"Wellington Agreement,\" Hartford paid $2 million on its 1978-1979 and 1979-1980 policies for judgments or settlements of asbestos bodily injury claims. At that time Hartford gave notice to Fibreboard that these payments exhausted the combined \"products hazard\" aggregate limits for the two policies in question.</p>\n<p>Against this background, Hartford requested that Fibreboard dismiss this case and then moved for summary judgment after receiving no response. Based on amendments to Fibreboard's complaint, alleging facts from which it asserted new theories of coverage, the trial court denied Hartford's motion. After conducting some discovery, Hartford again moved for summary judgment, this time successfully.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Hartford Policies</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Fibreboard is demanding coverage under Hartford policies in effect from 1978 through 1985. Pursuant to these policies, Hartford undertook to pay on behalf of Fibreboard \"all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of: [\u00b6] (1) bodily injury or property damage to which the insurance applies caused by an occurrence or [\u00b6] (2) personal injury to which this insurance applies....\" The annual $1 million aggregate limits of liability for bodily injury and property damage under these policies apply separately to each of several situations, including the following: \"(1) all property damage arising out of premises or operations ... [and] (3) all bodily injury or property damage included within the products hazard and all property damage or bodily injury included within the completed operations hazard.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*499</span> The \"products hazard\" classification is defined as including \"bodily injury and property damage arising out of the named insured's products<sup>[1]</sup> or reliance upon a representation or warranty made at any time with respect thereto, but only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured and after physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others.\"</p>\n<p>Beginning with policies effective April 1, 1980, and for all policy years thereafter, each policy contained a special asbestos exclusion which provided that the insurance does not apply \"to bodily injury or property damage included within the completed operations or the products hazard for claims arising out of products containing asbestos manufactured by Fibreboard Corporation commonly referred to as `asbestos claims.'\"</p>\n<p>The policies in question also provided a separate aggregate limit of liability for \"personal injury\" claims. The policies define \"personal injury\" as \"injury, other than advertising injury, arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed during the policy period in the conduct of the insured's business: [\u00b6] 1. the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or of other defamatory or disparaging material, or a publication or utterance in violation of any individual's right of privacy; [\u00b6] 2. false arrest, detention or imprisonment, or malicious prosecution; [\u00b6] 3. wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of an individual's right of privacy; or [\u00b6] 4. discrimination or humiliation....\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Introduction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There are no disputed facts. The gist of Fibreboard's appeal is that the trial court misinterpreted the insurance policies, which led to erroneous conclusions concerning coverage. Our job is to affirm the summary judgment if, as is the case, there are no triable issues of material fact <i>and</i> the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) We use our independent judgment in deciding purely legal questions such as the interpretation of written instruments.</p>\n<p>Fibreboard complains that the trial court had it wrong when it ruled that all the underlying asbestos-in-buildings claims were products claims which, if covered at all, would come within the \"products hazard\" limits of liability. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*500</span> The court found that those limits were exhausted under the 1978 and 1979 policies and that the asbestos products exclusion present in the later policies applied to the remaining claims.</p>\n<p>It is Fibreboard's contention that many of the underlying claims are not subject to the \"products hazard\" limitation because they do not allege damages \"arising out of\" Fibreboard's products. They assert that claims based on theories such as concert of action, failure to disclose hazardous nature of products, civil conspiracy, failure to develop asbestos-free products and market share liability have \"nothing to do with any product manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by Fibreboard\" and, thus, are not subject to the limits of liability for \"products hazard.\" This being the case, Fibreboard insists there is coverage under the \"premises-operations\" clause as well as under the personal injury provisions. After examining the insuring provisions for property damage/bodily injury and personal injury, we conclude the trial court correctly ruled on Hartford's summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Underlying Claims, If Covered at All, Fall Within Hartford's Bodily Injury/Property Damage Coverage Under the \"Products Hazard\" Classification</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Hartford policies provide property damage and/or bodily injury coverage for distinct hazards related to Fibreboard's business as a manufacturer. We are concerned here with the separate coverage which the premiums afford for \"premises-operations\" and for \"products hazard/completed operations.\" Under the policies, the annual $1 million aggregate cap on liability applies separately to each category.</p>\n<p>As explained by a noted commentator, a manufacturer or person who performs a service can incur liability in a number of ways, including \"(1) while work is in progress, [and] (2) after completion.... An injury or loss may result while an activity is in progress, and prior to the completion thereof, either as a result of an act of negligence or an omission. Such liability is embraced within the ordinary liability aspect of a public liability policy under coverage for premises-operations. [\u00b6] ... [O]nce a product has been completed and sent to market ... liability may be incurred by reason of a defect in merchandise or improper workmanship. It should be clear that the premises-operations coverage is not appropriate coverage and the individual now needs `products liability' or `completed operations' coverage. The coverages are complementary and not overlapping....\" (7A Appelman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1979) \u00a7 4508, pp. 340-341.) Thus, as a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> matter of sequencing, \"it is well to recognize that products liability is a coverage that takes over where premises-operations leaves off....\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 340; <i>Lindley Chemical</i> v. <i>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">71 N.C. App. 400</span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320089\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320089/lindley-chemical-v-hartford-acc-indem/\">322 S.E.2d 185</a></span>, 187].)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) <i>Scope of \"Products Hazard\" Clause: Traditional Products Liability Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>What, then, is the scope of a products hazard clause? More than 20 years ago this court decided a case involving a products hazard <i>exclusionary</i> clause phrased in language quite similar to the pertinent coverage provision at issue here. (<i>Cravens, Dargan &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Pacific Indem. Co.</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. App.3d 594</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">105 Cal. Rptr. 607</span>].)<sup>[2]</sup> There, the insured, Moyer Chemical, recommended and sold an insecticide which damaged a farmer's seedling tomato crop. Pacific Indemnity, one of the liability insurers, specifically excluded \"products hazard\" from the scope of coverage. The other insurers unsuccessfully sought indemnity and declaratory relief against Pacific Indemnity.</p>\n<p>The trial court concluded that the insecticide was defective and that the defect directly caused the damage. It apparently determined Pacific Indemnity was not liable for indemnity on the basis of the exclusionary \"products hazard\" clause.</p>\n<p>The appellants tried on various arguments to evade the exclusionary clause and land within the general liability coverage under general negligence principles. For example, they emphasized that Moyer recommended, but did not actually manufacture, the product in question. Further, Moyer failed to test the product and failed to warn about its effect on seedlings.</p>\n<p>We found the \"products hazard\" provision controlling, first pointing out that the clause was \"clear and positive.\" (<i>Cravens, Dargan &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Pacific Indem. Co., supra,</i> 29 Cal. App.3d at p. 599.) We held that all the acts and omissions attributed to Moyer were part of the integrated but excluded process of manufacture, handling and sale. (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 599-602.) Only acts \"sufficiently removed from the quality of the product in question\" would escape the exclusionary provision. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 601.) In contrast, the whole <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> process of failing to warn about, and positively recommending, a product \"was so merged as to fall within the kind of liability which the insured decided not to pay for when purchasing defendant's policy.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the court in <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i> v. <i>Richmond</i> (1977) <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Cal. App.3d 645</span>, 654-655 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">143 Cal. Rptr. 75</span>] held that negligence of the insured's employees in selecting and adjusting ski bindings contributed to the defect in the product and did \"not exempt the cause of damages from the products liability exclusion.\" The court went on to observe that products cases almost always involve some preexisting negligence, concluding that \"`... if the allegation of pre-existing negligence were to be regarded as controlling, the result would be to emasculate the product liability exclusion.'\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 655.)</p>\n<p>So, too, an Oregon reviewing court has held that products hazard coverage applies to any claim for damages arising from a product, including claims based on failure to warn, negligent design, and representations about the product. (<i>Laminated Wood Products</i> v. <i>Pedersen</i> (1985) 76 Ore.App. 662 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">711 P.2d 165</span>, 170].)</p>\n<p>Within the framework of the Hartford policies and the continuum of coverage provided for liability stemming from operations and products, it is obvious that the traditional products claims in the underlying complaints, namely, those asserting negligent testing, design, manufacture and sale; strict liability for design and manufacturing defects; failure to warn; breach of warranties; misrepresentation and the like, are within the four walls of the \"products hazard\" clause.</p>\n<p>Conversely, these traditional products claims would not be covered by the operations-premises clause. This would be so even where the tortious conduct was a failure to warn about the dangers of asbestos, because it is precisely the conduct of failing to warn that renders the product defective and, hence, calls into play the \"products hazard\" clause. (See <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1232223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1232223/anderson-v-owens-corning-fiberglas-corp/\">53 Cal.3d 987</a></span>, 995 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1232223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1232223/anderson-v-owens-corning-fiberglas-corp/\">281 Cal. Rptr. 528</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">810 P.2d 549</span>] [strict liability invoked for \"`warning defects,' i.e., inadequate warnings or failures to warn\"].)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) <i>Scope of \"Products Hazard\" Clause: Collective Liability Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The real issue in this case is whether more sophisticated products liability theories \u0097 those focussing on industry-wide tortious behavior in manufacturing and marketing defective products where any individual manufacturer's product may not be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury \u0097 are within the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> umbrella of either the \"products hazard\" or the premises-operations clauses. Fibreboard claims that concert of action, conspiracy and certain market share causes of action are not within the \"products hazard\" clause but are embraced within the operations coverage. Hartford argues the opposite on each point.</p>\n<p>(1) Fibreboard insists that the \"products hazard\" clause is in the nature of an exclusion which limits coverage, that it is ambiguous, and should be construed against Hartford. We realize that in the context of this lawsuit, the products hazard coverage does not afford protection for most asbestos-in-buildings claims because two years into their contractual relationship the parties agreed to an endorsement excluding claims arising out of asbestos products manufactured by Fibreboard. But within the structure of the policies the exclusionary language goes to a particular product, not to the products coverage in general. Indeed, the \"products hazard\" is one of the classifications to which the liability limits for coverage for bodily injury and property damage apply. Therefore, our job is to give effect to the \"products hazard\" clause as a term of coverage.</p>\n<p>In doing so, we are mindful that the overarching goal of contract interpretation is to honor the parties' mutual intentions as of the time of contracting. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) (2) \"Where contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to an absurd result, we ascertain this intent from the written provisions and go no further. [Citations.] The words of a contract generally are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense unless the parties use them in a technical sense or `a special meaning is given to them by usage....'\" (<i>Helfand</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 869</span>, 879 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">13 Cal. Rptr.2d 295</span>].)</p>\n<p>As we explain, we agree with Hartford that the collective liability claims, if covered at all, would fall within the \"products hazard\" provision. (3) We do not find the \"products hazard\" term and, in particular, the \"arising out of the insured's products\" language to be ambiguous. As the trial court noted, these words are words of broader significance than \"caused by.\" We agree: California courts generally have given the terms \"arising out of\" or \"arising from\" their commonsense meaning, concluding that they connote more than mere causation. For example, our Supreme Court has explained that California cases have established that the \"arising out of the use\" language found in insuring clauses of automobile liability policies \"has broad and comprehensive application, and affords coverage for injuries bearing almost <i>any</i> causal relation with the vehicle.\" (<i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Partridge</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal.3d 94</span>, 100 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">109 Cal. Rptr. 811</span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> <span class=\"citation no-link\">514 P.2d 123</span>].) The court went on to state that \"[s]ome minimal causal connection between the vehicle and the accident is, however, required.\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 100, fn. 7.) So, too, other cases have equated \"arising out of\" with \"`... origination, growth or flow[ing] from the event.'\" (See <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co.</i> v. <i>Civil Service Employees Ins. Co.</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\">33 Cal. App.3d 26</span>, 32 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">108 Cal. Rptr. 737</span>]; <i>Pacific Indem. Co.</i> v. <i>Truck Ins. Exch.</i> (1969) <span class=\"citation no-link\">270 Cal. App.2d 700</span>, 704 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Cal. Rptr. 281</span>].) As summed up by a federal court applying California law to determine the scope of an exclusionary clause and the key concept of \"arising from\" or \"arising out of\": \"`\"Arising out of\" are words of much broader significance than \"caused by.\" They are ordinarily understood to mean \"originating from\" \"having its origin in,\" \"growing out of\" or \"flowing from\" or in short, \"incident to, or having connection with\"....'\" (<i>Continental Cas. Co.</i> v. <i>City of Richmond</i> (9th Cir.1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">763 F.2d 1076</span>, 1080.)</p>\n<p>Fibreboard calls our attention to the more recent case of <i>Farmers Ins. Exchange</i> v. <i>Reed</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">200 Cal. App.3d 1230</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">248 Cal. Rptr. 11</span>], in which the reviewing court interpreted language in an automobile liability policy obligating the insurer to \"pay damages for which any insured person was legally liable `because of bodily injury to any person ... arising out of the ... use of a private passenger car....'\" (At p. 1232.) Focusing on the concept of \"use,\" the court indicated that use of the car \"must be a `\"predominating cause\"' or a `\"substantial factor\"' in causing the injury.\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1233.)</p>\n<p>More pertinent factually, Fibreboard also cites an Ohio case which held: \"Unless it is shown that the damages were caused by the insured's product, products liability principles, and therefore, the products hazard exclusion, does not apply to exclude coverage.\" (<i>Buckeye Union Ins.</i> v. <i>Liberty Solv. &amp; Chem.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Ohio App.3d 127</span> [17 Ohio B.R. 225, <span class=\"citation no-link\">477 N.E.2d 1227</span>, 1237], concluding the exclusion did not bar liability under the federal \"Superfund Act\" because Superfund liability arises by reason of the defendant's status as a generator of hazardous waste products, not by reason of a defective condition in the product; disagreed with on another point in <i>Hybud Equip.</i> v. <i>Sphere Drake Ins.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">64 Ohio St.3d 657</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">597 N.E.2d 1096</span>].)</p>\n<p>Here, of course, each claim will require proof that Fibreboard's products were defective. More to the point, by tendering the issue as one of causation, Fibreboard misses the mark. The policies predicate coverage on the insured's legal liability to pay damages because of bodily injury or property damages \"arising out of the named insured's products.\" In this context, the phrase \"arising out of\" \"does not `purport to regulate the theory of liability or the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> standard of causation....'\" (<i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Salas</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">222 Cal. App.3d 268</span>, 274, fn. 4 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">271 Cal. Rptr. 642</span>]; see also <i>Transport Indemnity Co.</i> v. <i>Schnack</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation no-link\">131 Cal. App.3d 149</span>, 151-152 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">182 Cal. Rptr. 256</span>].) Rather, it identifies a core factual nucleus, i.e., products manufactured, sold or distributed by the insured, and links that nucleus to the bodily injury or property damage covered under the policy. This link is not made in terms of tort causation. Tort causation is assumed within the requirement of the general insuring clause that the insured be found legally liable to pay damages. (<i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Salas, supra,</i> 222 Cal. App.3d at p. 274, fn. 4.) The \"arising out of\" embellishment then broadly links the insureds' products with the resulting bodily injury or property damage.</p>\n<p>We come to the obvious: the gravamen of all the underlying complaints is that Fibreboard manufactured, sold and distributed defective asbestos products. All allege damage to property and the threat of harm to the health of those who use the plaintiff's buildings which contain these products. Beyond these core product allegations, the complaints posit various levels of wrongful behavior on the part of the manufacturers. These include intentional failure to reveal risks; joint efforts with other industry members to suppress information regarding dangers of asbestos products and to market same without adequate testing or warnings; conspiracy to do the same. We turn now to the particulars of each of the theories of liability which Fibreboard claims remove certain actions from \"products hazard\" coverage.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> (a) <i>Concert of Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(4) Concert of action claims were alleged in complaints filed in a number of states. This theory seeks \"to deter hazardous group behavior.\" (<i>Abel</i> v. <i>Eli Lilly and Co.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1998188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1998188/abel-v-eli-lilly-co/\">418 Mich. 311</a></span> fn. 19 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1998188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1998188/abel-v-eli-lilly-co/\">343 N.W.2d 164</a></span>, 176].) Fibreboard's argument is that in some jurisdictions, a defendant can be held liable for damages caused by <i>another's</i> product because it is the tortious conduct of the group which is deemed to cause the harm to plaintiff, not any one manufacturer's particular product. For example, under Michigan law, \"[a] plaintiff may proceed on the theory of concert of action if he or she can prove `that all defendants acted tortiously pursuant to a common design'.... `Even if defendant caused no harm himself, he is liable for the harm caused by his fellows because he acted jointly.' [Citation.] `[T]o state a cause of action, a plaintiff need only allege that the defendants were jointly engaged in tortious activity as a result of which the plaintiff was harmed.'\" (<i>Cousineau</i> v. <i>Ford Motor Co.</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">140 Mich. App. 19</span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2232706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2232706/cousineau-v-ford-motor-co/\">363 N.W.2d 721</a></span>, 728].)</p>\n<p>As the Michigan Supreme Court explained: \"This theory, although not developed to ease plaintiff's traditional burden of proof of causation, may have that effect. If plaintiffs can establish that all defendants acted tortiously pursuant to a common design, they will all be held liable for the entire result. [\u00b6] The concept is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the racing context. If three drivers join in a drag race, as a result of which one pedestrian is injured, all three may be held liable. <i>Thus a legal fiction is created: all three drivers are found to be the cause in fact, although only one driver may have actually struck the pedestrian.</i>\" (<i>Abel</i> v. <i>Eli Lilly and Co., supra,</i> 343 N.W.2d at p. 176, italics added.) This court went on to find that the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for concert of action based on allegations that \"defendants acted together in negligently manufacturing and promoting drugs which were ineffective and dangerous, were inadequately tested, and were distributed without sufficient warnings.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>In the context of the underlying claims, the group is manufacturers of products containing asbestos. The hazardous behavior is producing, promoting, selling and supplying asbestos-containing products without conducting adequate testing, without providing adequate warnings, etc. Because Fibreboard is alleged to be part of this concerted, hazardous group effort, its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> conduct in manufacturing and marketing asbestos-containing products would be deemed to be the cause in fact of property damages to \"X\" school even if its products were not installed in \"X\" school. Under the legal fiction of this theory, plaintiff's injuries indeed \"arise out of\" Fibreboard's products.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(b) <i>Civil Conspiracy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Civil conspiracy claims have been brought against Fibreboard in Texas, California and other jurisdictions. Typical allegations are that pursuant to agreement with other manufacturers, Fibreboard suppressed information about the dangers of asbestos and marketed asbestos-containing products without adequate testing or warning. In a leading case involving cigarette manufacturers, the reviewing court explained the scope of liability for civil conspiracy: \"Appellees' basic position is that a single cigarette manufacturer has a duty to inform <i>only</i> the users or consumers of any hazards associated with the use of its own products and that, under no circumstances, would a cigarette manufacturer's duty to warn, extend to the users of a competitor's product. We disagree.... [\u00b6] ... [T]he law of civil conspiracy makes non-supplying cigarette manufacturers, subject to liability for failure to warn cigarette smokers of the dangers of cigarette smoking....\" (<i>Rogers</i> v. <i>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</i> (Tex. Ct. App. 1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">761 S.W.2d 788</span>, 797.)</p>\n<p>(5) \"`The elements of an action for civil conspiracy are the formation and operation of the conspiracy and damage resulting to plaintiff from an act or acts done in furtherance of the common design.... In such an action the major significance of the conspiracy lies in the fact that it renders each participant in the wrongful act responsible as a joint tortfeasor for all damages ensuing from the wrong, irrespective of whether or not he was a direct actor and regardless of the degree of his activity. [Citations.]'\" (<i>Doctors' Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.3d 39</span>, 44 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">260 Cal. Rptr. 183</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">775 P.2d 508</span>].)</p>\n<p>(6) Analytically, as with the concert of action theory, liability for civil conspiracy permits the legal fiction that each conspiring defendant legally caused plaintiff's injuries even though only one defendant may be the direct actor causing the specific harm. Thus, under a civil conspiracy action, Fibreboard could be legally liable for property damage and bodily injury even though its particular product was not incorporated in plaintiff's building. It is nonetheless as if Fibreboard's products caused the harm and, thus, the harm arises from, flows from, and originates from Fibreboard's products.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(c) <i>Market Share Liability</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Unlike the substantive law of California, market share liability in certain jurisdictions can be imposed even if a defendant could prove that its product <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> did not contribute to plaintiff's injury.<sup>[4]</sup> New York is such a jurisdiction, and Fibreboard has been sued there. In a recent case against manufactures of the drug \"DES,\" the New York high court adopted a market share theory using a national market and further explained: \"[B]ecause liability here is based on the over-all risk produced, and not causation in a single case, there should be no exculpation of a defendant who, although a member of the market producing DES for pregnancy use, appears not to have caused a particular plaintiff's injury. It is merely a windfall for a producer to escape liability solely because it manufactured a more identifiable pill, or sold only to certain drugstores. These fortuities in no way diminish the culpability of a defendant for marketing the product, which is the basis of liability here.\" (<i>Hymowitz</i> v. <i>Eli Lilly and Co.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">73 N.Y.2d 487</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">541 N.Y.S.2d 941</span>, 950, <span class=\"citation no-link\">539 N.E.2d 1069</span>].)</p>\n<p>In a <i>Hymowitz</i> situation a defendant manufacturer will have to pay the plaintiff for injuries suffered from a generic product on the basis of its share of a defined market for that product, regardless of whether it can establish it did not cause the harm. (7) Again, because of its culpability in creating the market by producing and selling its own products, a given producer will be treated as if it caused a portion of an injury even when it can disprove causation. Liability stems from the defendant's products and, thus, falls within the \"products hazard\" coverage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(4) <i>There Is No Coverage for Products Claims Under the Premises-operations Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(8a) Having said all this, even if we were to agree with Fibreboard that these industry-wide liability claims are not products claims within the meaning of the \"products hazard\" clause, they would not repose within the operations-premises clause. Fibreboard urges that since the policies do not define the term \"operations,\" we should construe it strictly against the insurer to include all of Fibreboard's behavior and activities related to \"manufacturing, selling or distributing goods or products.\" It points to the definition of \"foreign based operations\" which includes \"manufacturing, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*509</span> selling or distributing goods or products at or from locations outside the United States....\" Against this analysis Fibreboard posits that the separate $1 million annual aggregate that it purchased as operations insurance should cover underlying claims alleging concerted action, civil conspiracy, etc.</p>\n<p>Not so. (9) First, merely because a word or term is not specially defined does not mean we strictly construe it against the insurer.<sup>[5]</sup> We do not declare ambiguities by isolating phrases and considering them in the abstract; rather, we construe the provision in the context of the instrument as a whole and in the circumstances of the case. (<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th 1254</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. Rptr.2d 538</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">833 P.2d 545</span>]; <i>Helfand</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra,</i> 10 Cal. App.4th at p. 880.) (8b) Second, the phrase \"foreign based operations\" is a limitation on the definition of \"policy territory,\" not on the scope of a substantive type of coverage.</p>\n<p>Third, although we agree with Fibreboard that we must read the term \"operations\" in its \"ordinary and popular sense\"<sup>[6]</sup> (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644; <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 2 Cal.4th at p. 1265), we must also apply this meaning within the context of the function and structure of each policy as a whole. Here, each policy avails a separate $1 million coverage cap for property damage arising out of operations and for bodily injury/property damages arising out of products. Construing each policy as a whole, we conclude it is unreasonable to align activities concerning failure to warn of product hazards, suppression of product safety information, conspiring to market unsafe products, and the like within the ambit of operations coverage rather than products coverage.</p>\n<p>After all, an underlying condition which rendered the products defective and led to the property damage at issue was failure to warn of inherent dangers. Add an extra level of culpability for conspiracy and concerted action to suppress the damning information about the dangers, and you are still squarely within the mode of behavior which caused the product to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*510</span> defective in the first place. If the planning and decisions that render the product defective are allocated to operations instead of products liability, then the policy distinction between the two coverages is lost.</p>\n<p>The trial court summed it up well when it observed that all management decisions about disclosures, warnings, etc., \"are inherent in any product liability case. [\u00b6] You have, first of all, just blameless placing the product on the market. Then you have you should have known but you didn't know that it was going to hurt somebody placing the product on the market, and then you have the you knew darn well and you did it anyway in order to make a buck placing the product on the market. But basically, that's all the same case with the only difference being what the particular state of mind of the manufacturer was.... [A]ll ... would be included under the products hazard [<i>sic</i>] definition. The only question is whether or not because some states don't require the plaintiff to point out the defendant's product in court, whether that changes the analysis of this matter.\" On the basis of this analysis, the court went on to hold that a separate limit under operations would not be available to Fibreboard. We concur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(5) <i>The Conspiracy Allegations Do Not Amount to \"Occurrences\"</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(10) Hartford also correctly points out that in any event claims based on conspiracy theories are not covered by Hartford's policies because they do not and cannot allege damage caused by an \"occurrence.\" The Hartford policies provided coverage for bodily injury or property damage \"caused by an occurrence.\" \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"<i>an accident,</i> including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>A \"civil conspiracy\" entails formation and operation of the conspiracy and acts done in furtherance of the common design. (<i>Doctors' Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 49 Cal.3d at p. 44.) In other words, \"a person, or defendant, cannot <i>inadvertently become a member of a civil conspiracy.</i>\" (<i>Rogers</i> v. <i>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., supra,</i> 761 S.W.2d at p. 797.) \"`\"... [T]here must be a preconceived plan and unity of design and purpose, <i>for the common design is of the essence of the conspiracy.</i>\"'\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 796, italics in original.) Thus, there is a conscious, decisionmaking element that takes civil conspiracies out of the range of behavior encompassed within the meaning of an \"occurrence.\" An insured who participates in a conspiracy, even if the agreed upon behavior or course of conduct is to act negligently, cannot expect coverage for \"an accident.\" In its plain, ordinary sense, an accident is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*511</span> \"an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance.\" (Webster's New Collegiate Dict. (9th ed. 1984) p. 49.) As a matter of law, a civil conspiracy cannot occur by accident; therefore, the policies afford no coverage for these claims. (See <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. App.4th 846</span>, 860-861 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254333/chatton-v-national-union-fire-ins-co/\">13 Cal.

Rptr.2d 629</span>].)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Personal Injury Clause Does Not Apply to Any of the Underlying Offenses</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(11a) Fibreboard finally contends that the trial court erred in ruling that the policies did not afford separate coverage under the \"personal injury\" provisions for causes of action labelled trespass or nuisance. We disagree with Fibreboard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(1) <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(12) In the world of liability insurance, personal injury coverage applies to injury which arises out of the commission of certain enumerated acts or offenses. (See 3 Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1992) \u00a7 49.51[1], pp. XX-XXX-XX-XXX; <i>Titan Holdings Syndicate</i> v. <i>City of Keene, N.H.</i> (1st Cir.1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">898 F.2d 265</span>, 269 (<i>Titan</i>).) Coverage thus is triggered by the offense, not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers.</p>\n<p>(11b) The offenses covered by our policies divide into four groups: libel and slander torts; false arrest, detention and malicious prosecution; nonemployment related discrimination or humiliation; and \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of an individual's right of privacy.\" It is this latter grouping with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p>The listed offenses in turn are not separately defined in the policies. We thus give them meaning by reference to their common law elements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) <i>There Are No Allegations That Can Be Classified as Wrongful Entry or Eviction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Fibreboard first suggests there is coverage for what it calls trespass claims under the specified torts of wrongful entry or eviction. Hartford has provided us with numerous references to state law codifications and variations of a tort of forcible entry or wrongful entry. Common to many is the use or threat of force to dispossess. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1159.) Although wrongful entry can describe a trespass committed for the specific purpose of dispossessing the owner or occupant of land, we agree with Fibreboard that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*512</span> it can also describe a more general, \"simple trespass\" involving no intent to dispossess: \"`Every wrongful entry upon land in the occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass....'\" (<i>MacLeod</i> v. <i>Fox West Coast T. Corp.</i> (1937) <span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal.2d 383</span>, 387 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">74 P.2d 276</span>].)</p>\n<p>However, the underlying complaints do not, and cannot, describe an actionable trespass because there is no direct or indirect entry or intrusion by Fibreboard upon the plaintiffs' lands. That the particular manner in which the product becomes a health hazard \u0097 namely, contamination through the release and dispersion of microscopic asbestos fibers, filaments and dust throughout the atmosphere of the surrounding properties \u0097 is in the nature of an invasion of land does not mean we have a trespass as to defendant manufacturer. At the heart of all the complaints is the allegation that Fibreboard placed defective products into the stream of commerce without alerting the public as to their hazardous nature. Plaintiffs, not knowing the products were hazardous, purchased them and incorporated them into their buildings. The purchase of the products with the resulting transfer of ownership and control to plaintiffs halts the directive flow of the product by defendants and takes these cases out of the trespass paradigm. It is the plaintiffs' property, voluntarily incorporated into the buildings with plaintiffs' permission, that is causing the harm and, thus, there is no third party interference sufficient to sustain trespass liability. Fibreboard may be liable for many wrongs, but they did not commit a trespass by selling a bad product. That the product ends up on a person's land and is intended to be used on the land does not change the picture. All products end up in a physical location that is owned by someone. If they are defective and cause harm, the manufacturer will be liable under a variety of products liability theories but not for a wrongful entry or invasion upon the land.</p>\n<p>Fibreboard calls our attention to two cases involving misrepresentations or failure to warn in connection with the sale of products wherein an insured was held to have a duty to defend on the basis of potential personal injury coverage. However these cases found coverage under a variant of our wrongful eviction and entry clause which ended with the catchall phrase \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\" (<i>American States Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Canyon Creek</i> (N.D.Cal. 1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379925\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379925/american-states-ins-co-v-canyon-creek/\">786 F. Supp. 821</a></span>;<sup>[7]</sup><i>Pipefitters Welfare</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*513</span> <i>Educ. Fund</i> v. <i>Westchester Fire</i> (7th Cir.1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592117\"><a href=\"/opinion/592117/pipefitters-welfare-educational-fund-a-missouri-employee-benefits-fund-v/\">976 F.2d 1037</a></span>.<sup>[8]</sup>)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) <i>The Personal Injury Endorsement Does Not Cover the Nuisance-related Actions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Fibreboard also contends that the personal injury endorsement covers nuisance actions or, indeed, any alleged interference with the use, enjoyment or occupancy of property. The underlying complaints are replete with such allegations.</p>\n<p>Again, cases interpreting the \"other invasion of an individual's right of private occupancy\" language have so held. (See, e.g., <i>Titan, supra,</i> 898 F.2d at p. 273, holding that underlying allegations that noxious odors, noise and light from the city's sewage treatment plant interfered with the homeowner's quiet enjoyment of their property and deprived them of its use were sufficient to come within coverage for liability arising from \"`other invasion of the right of private occupancy.'\") However, Hartford argues persuasively that the catchall term found in our policies, namely, \"other invasion of an individual's right of privacy,\" is aimed at a distinctly different type of tort.</p>\n<p>The trial court expressed in colloquy with counsel that the parties must have meant something akin to \"right of private occupancy\" instead of \"right of privacy.\" It reasoned that since the libel and slander category of offenses ended with the phrase, \"a publication or utterance in violation of any individual's right of privacy,\" the wrongful entry/wrongful eviction category would not be referring to the same kind of privacy interest relating to utterances and publications. Moreover, because the phrase was \"tacked on\" to the wrongful entry or eviction block of offenses, it was more in the nature of the right of private occupancy.</p>\n<p>However, the right of privacy has been described as the right \"to be let alone,\" which can be tortiously invaded in diverse ways and in diverse contexts. (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652A, com. a, at p. 376; <i>Miller</i> v. <i>National Broadcasting Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">187 Cal. App.3d 1463</span>, 1481-1482 [232 Cal. Rptr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> 668, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 A.L.R.4th 1027</span>].) At common law the invasion of the right of privacy has clustered into four distinct wrongs, \"whose only relation to one another is that each involves interference with the interest of the individual in leading, to some reasonable extent, a secluded and private life, free from the prying eyes, ears and publications of others.\" (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652A, com. b, at p. 377.) The four forms of tortious invasion are: unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another; appropriation of the other's name or likeness; unreasonable publicity given to the other's private life; and publicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before the public. (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 652A, at p. 376; Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 117, pp. 851-868.)</p>\n<p>The first category of privacy rights protects an individual's right to be secure from intrusion. The Restatement defines the offensive conduct this way: \"One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\" (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652B, at p. 378.) In <i>Miller</i> the reviewing court concluded that the plaintiff stated a cause of action for invasion of privacy by intrusion based on a television crew's entry into her home, without consent, at a time of confusion and vulnerability occasioned by her husband's heart seizure. (<i>Miller</i> v. <i>National Broadcasting Co., supra,</i> 187 Cal. App.3d at p. 1484.)</p>\n<p>As the Restatement further explains, this form of invasion of privacy \"may be by physical intrusion into a place in which the plaintiff has secluded himself, as when the defendant forces his way into the plaintiff's room in a hotel or insists over the plaintiff's objection in entering his home. It may also be by the use of the defendant's senses, with or without mechanical aids, to oversee or overhear the plaintiff's private affairs, as by looking into his upstairs windows with binoculars or tapping his telephone wires. It may be by some other form of investigation or examination into his private concerns, as by opening his private and personal mail, searching his safe or his wallet, examining his private bank account....\" (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652B, com. b, at pp. 378-379.)</p>\n<p>Fibreboard's entire argument for finding coverage for claims of nuisance and other allegations of interference with real property rights stems from its analysis of cases which have interpreted and applied the \"other invasion of the private right of occupancy\" variant of personal injury coverage. For example, in California the listing \"wrongful entry, eviction and invasions of the right of private occupancy\" has been held to pertain to torts against real <span class=\"star-pagination\">*515</span> property as a matter of law. (<i>Waranch</i> v. <i>Gulf Insurance Co.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">218 Cal. App.3d 356</span>, 361 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">266 Cal. Rptr. 827</span>].) However, the <i>Waranch</i> court also made it clear that the key term \"`\"[o]ccupancy\" ordinarily refers to \"the taking and holding possession of real property under a lease or tenancy at will.\" [Citation.] The association of \"occupancy\" with real property ... is reinforced by its conjunction with the words \"wrongful entry or eviction.\" \"Eviction\" is a term almost exclusively associated with real property....'\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 359, quoting <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Great American Ins. Companies</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. App.3d 766</span>, 775-776 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">215 Cal. Rptr. 416</span>]; see also <i>Fragomeno</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of the West, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">207 Cal. App.3d 822</span>, 828.)</p>\n<p>The dynamic changes when the key term is \"privacy\" rather than \"occupancy.\" \"Privacy\" as a protected interest has its own meaning, separate from the interest of occupancy. Occupancy goes to the holding, possessing or residing in or on something; privacy goes to the individual's interest in being \"left alone.\" The scope of privacy interest as well as tortious invasions thereof are well defined in the treatises and cases. Reading the term \"other invasion of an individual's right of privacy,\" in conjunction with the offenses of wrongful entry and eviction, it is clear that the common thread is concern with aggressive or unwarranted intrusions or ousters. These may occur with respect to a person's land, home, or other quarters or physical space, or with respect to a person's private affairs or concerns. An intrusion upon the seclusion of another could well be accomplished by a trespass, wrongful entry or wrongful eviction.</p>\n<p>As we have explained, personal injury coverage focuses on the nature of the specified tort that causes the damage. To the extent the listed offenses are framed in generic terms, they should be construed broadly to encompass all specific torts which reasonably could fall within the general category. However, Fibreboard has not identified any tort alleged against it which would fall within the ambit of the invasion of privacy torts.</p>\n<p>The nuisance and other allegations going to interference with the plaintiffs' real property rights all have their roots in offending conduct which lies outside the scope of the personal injury coverage afforded by the policies in question. In other words, the offending behavior which created the public health hazard (public nuisance allegations) or interfered with plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property (private nuisance claims) invariably constituted the litany of products-based torts already described \u0097 negligent failure to warn; conspiracy to suppress damaging information about products; concert of action in marketing hazardous products; etc. The essence of the nuisance-related actions is that the sum of the defendant-manufacturers' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*516</span> tortious behavior created public and private nuisances on plaintiffs' property. But the underlying discrete offenses are not among the enumerated torts coming within the definition of personal injury and, in particular, they do not constitute wrongful evictions, wrongful entries or invasions of privacy.</p>\n<p>Finally, we concur with Hartford that the plaintiffs in the underlying cases have no protectable privacy interest because they are corporations, partnerships<sup>[9]</sup> and public entities, not natural persons.<sup>[10]</sup> \"The right protected by the action for invasion of privacy is a personal right, peculiar to the individual whose privacy is invaded.\" (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652I, com. a, at p. 403.) \"A corporation, partnership or unincorporated association has no personal right of privacy.\" (<i>Id.,</i> com. c, at p. 403.) Therefore, as a matter of law the plaintiffs pursuing the underlying claims cannot state a cause of action for invasion of privacy. (<i>N.O.C., Inc.</i> v. <i>Schaefer</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1524474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1524474/noc-inc-v-schaefer/\">197 N.J. Super. 249</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">484 A.2d 729</span>, 730-731].)</p>\n<p>For all these reasons we conclude the trial court correctly determined that the personal injury coverage has no application for the underlying claims because they do not allege an offense within the scope of that coverage.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Poche, J., and Perley, J., concurred.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The term \"named insured's products\" is defined as \"goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name....\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The policy defined \"products hazard\" as \"`... [g]oods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name if the accident or occurrence occurs after possession of such goods or products has been relinquished to others by the named insured or by others trading under his name if such action or occurrence occurs away from premises owned, rented, or controlled by the named insured.'\" (29 Cal. App.3d at pp. 596-597.)</p>\n<p>[3]  In its reply brief Fibreboard contends that it has alluded to certain specific types of claims as falling outside the scope of products hazard, but that these are just examples. Variations on these theories may be asserted, and Fibreboard seems to be \"reserving\" its right to say these potential claims are also outside the scope. We of course analyze Hartford's duty only with respect to the specific claims and specific points discussed on appeal and within the four corners of the forty-two underlying complaints.\n</p>\n<p>We note that one complaint asserts a cause of action under the Superfund Act. Amicus curiae mentioned the issue, but Fibreboard did not brief it. Hartford has deemed the matter waived, and Fibreboard did not contest this understanding in its reply brief. We deem the matter waived.</p>\n<p>Fibreboard also mentions, without citation to authority or to the record, that allegations concerning failure to disclose to purchasers of other manufacturers' products that asbestos is hazardous, and failure to develop asbestos-free products are claims having \"nothing to do\" with any product that Fibreboard manufactured or sold. The first set of allegations is within the various conspiracy and concerted action claims. Failure to develop asbestos-free products is but the flip side of having made, and being subject to liability for having made, a defective asbestos-containing product; this allegation poses no independent theory which we must independently analyze.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that amicus curiae in support of Fibreboard argues that any liability for failure to warn is outside the products hazard clause. The two cases which amicus curiae cites are inapposite or suspect. In the first, <i>Cooling</i> v. <i>United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co.</i> (La. Ct. App. 1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">269 So.2d 294</span>, 297-298, the court concluded that the product was not defective, and the alleged failure to warn of the need for including safety devices was in the nature of a general risk of doing business. Here, the asbestos products <i>are defective</i> precisely because of the absence of warning about their dangers. The second case (<i>Scarborough</i> v. <i>Northern Assur. Co. of America</i> (5th Cir.1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">718 F.2d 130</span>) applies Louisiana law and, accordingly, relies on <i>Cooling.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  California has adopted a burden shifting approach to market share liability: each defendant facing liability on this basis is responsible for a proportion of the judgment represented by the share of the relevant market \"unless it demonstrates that it could not have made the product which caused plaintiff's injuries.\" (<i>Sindell</i> v. <i>Abbott Laboratories</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Cal.3d 588</span>, 612 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">163 Cal. Rptr. 132</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">607 P.2d 924</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 A.L.R.4th 1061</span>].) Moreover, this court has declined to extend the market share theory of liability to the cases seeking removal of asbestos products from residential housing. (<i>Mullen</i> v. <i>Armstrong World Industries, Inc.</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">200 Cal. App.3d 250</span>, 252, 257 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">246 Cal. Rptr. 32</span>].) We reasoned that the prerequisite of fungibility had not been met because asbestos products were not produced from an identical formula and carried more than one risk of harm. (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 256-257.)</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>CNA Casualty of California</i> v. <i>Seaboard Surety Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">176 Cal. App.3d 598</span>, 613 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">222 Cal. Rptr. 276</span>], upon which Fibreboard relies, says as much. However, <i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> v. <i>Sam Harris Constr. Co.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal.3d 409</span>, 412 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">149 Cal. Rptr. 292</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">583 P.2d 1335</span>], upon which <i>CNA</i> in turn relies, does not abrogate the starting point of interpretation, namely, the identification of an ambiguity or uncertainty.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary (1989) page 1009 offers these pertinent definitions for \"operation\": \"1. The act or an instance, process, or manner of functioning or operating.... 5. A process of a practical or mechanical nature in some form of work or production; ... 6. A course or procedure of productive or industrial activity....\" Fibreboard supplies us with another definition: \"[T]he whole process of planning for and operating a business or other organized unit.\" (Webster's New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1965) p. 1581.)</p>\n<p>[7]  In <i>American States,</i> the plaintiff homeowners in the underlying action alleged that the insured, engaged in the sale of manufactured housing, falsely represented that the purchasers would have the right to own and occupy the real property on which their mobile homes were located and that the county would approve the housing development as a subdivision. The court held these allegations triggered coverage under the \"other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" language. This language invokes the duty to defend any action which potentially constitutes \"`an invasion of the right of private occupancy which incurs tort liability as opposed to contract liability.'\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 828, quoting <i>Fragomeno</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of the West</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">207 Cal. App.3d 822</span>, 828 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">255 Cal. Rptr. 111</span>].)</p>\n<p>[8]  The court in <i>Pipefitters</i> found a duty to defend a suit on allegations that the seller of a used transformer failed to warn the purchasing scrap metal company that the transformer contained polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Upon preparing the transformer for scrap, PCB-laced oil contaminated the property, leading to imposition of a seal order and an environmental reclamation lien. Finding coverage within the \"other invasion of the right to private occupancy\" prong of the personal injury definition, the court concluded a reasonable policyholder would see the alleged negligence as impairing the plaintiff's right to occupy its property. (976 F.2d at pp. 1040-1042.)</p>\n<p>[9]  One plaintiff, a limited partnership, is pursuing the complaint as a class action. However, the complaint only identifies the following discrete torts: negligence, strict liability, breach of warranties, fraud and misrepresentation, concert of action, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of injury (punitive damages) and breach of postmanufacture/sale duty.</p>\n<p>[10]  Fibreboard points out that the limits of liability provisions explicitly list organizations and persons as the targets for sustaining personal injury damages covered under the policies. Indeed, some of the specific offenses listed under the personal injury clause would apply to corporations (e.g., defamation). However, that does not mean that all of the listed offenses, as a matter of tort law, apply to organizations! Moreover, the fact that some of the complaints refer to privacy invasions of natural persons does not elevate the corporate plaintiff's cause of action to one of invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p>[11]  We deny Hartford's motion to strike a portion of Fibreboard's reply brief. The objected to portion refers to matters which the trial court excluded from evidence. We treat Fibreboard's reference to these matters as an objection to the trial court's ruling and reaffirm that the matters are impermissible hearsay and irrelevant.</p>\n\n</div>",

Case law and treatises have always acknowledged that actions over easement ownership, interference, or the right to use an easement concern \"pure rights in property\" or intangible rights only. (See <i>Gunderson v. Fire Ins. Exchange</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) Easements, \u00a7\u00a7 15:1,15:5, pp. 4,16.)</p>\n<p>In line with <i>Gunderson,</i> we conclude, in contrast to the Court of Appeal, that an insurer providing a liability policy that covers damage to tangible property on the insured's premises has no duty to defend an easement dispute. For reasons explained below, we therefore reverse the Court of Appeal judgment and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with this conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts And Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs Zubair M. Kazi and Khatija Kazi (the Kazis) purchased land (Parcel A) from the State of California's Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy). C. David Tollakson and Lynn L. Tollakson (the Tollaksons) also purchased Conservancy land (Parcel B). In an informational booklet, the Conservancy informed prospective buyers that Parcels A and B shared a common driveway 20 feet in width that straddled the boundary line between the two parcels. The deeds made no reference to any express easement for a common driveway. When the Tollaksons bought Parcel B, however, they relied on the representations made in the informational booklet to assume an implied easement existed on Parcel A for a \"common driveway, for ingress, egress, and a right of way over and across Parcel A, parallel to the Boundary Line and for a width of not less than ten feet, all of which is appurtenant to Parcel B....\"</p>\n<p>In order to facilitate building on their property, the Kazis graded an access road on Parcel A, at or near the boundary line of Parcel B. Although the access road did not involve Parcel B, the Tollaksons complained to the Kazis that the grading interfered with their claimed implied easement and right-of-way over the Kazis' parcel, effectively ousting them from use and possession of their own Parcel B. When the Kazis denied the existence of an implied easement over Parcel A, the Tollaksons sued them in May 1990.</p>\n<p>The Tollaksons' complaint against the Kazis asserted causes of action for (1) declaratory and injunctive relief, (2) quiet title, (3) trespass to the common driveway easement, and (4) ejectment from the common driveway easement. Each cause of action essentially alleged that the Kazis' access road obstructed the Tollaksons' alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> implied easement over Parcel A. The complaint specifically noted that the entire dispute concerned the \"right of way over and across Parcel A, parallel to the Boundary Line and for a width of not less than ten feet, all of which is appurtenant to Parcel B....\"</p>\n<p>The Tollaksons also alleged in their complaint that they purchased their parcel from the Conservancy with the understanding that each parcel would be served by a common driveway straddling the property boundary line. They admitted, however, that the Conservancy never conveyed to them or to the Kazis any deed for an express easement in the common driveway. The Tollaksons complained that the Kazis \"denied the existence of an easement\" over their parcel for purposes of the common driveway, and that they \"have been grading and constructing on Parcel A in contravention of the existence of such common driveway easement and have obstructed the same, denying [the Tollaksons] the benefits of such easement.\" The complaint alleged no physical damage to either parcel, but essentially asserted that the Tollaksons would not have purchased Parcel B without the easement over Parcel A for the common driveway because without it, Parcel B was not buildable.</p>\n<p>The trespass claim sought $4,000 per month in damages and alleged that interference with the alleged implied easement diminished Parcel B's value by $400,000. The ejectment claim sought payment of $4,000 per month in damages for obstructing the easement. The Kazis denied the existence of an implied easement over Parcel A and refused to acknowledge any access interference.</p>\n<p>In August 1990, the Kazis tendered defense of the Tollaksons' complaint to their liability insurance carriers, defendants Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers), the primary insurance carrier, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm), and Truck Insurance Exchange (Truck). These policies covered property damage and personal injury, which included a duty to defend and indemnify the Kazis in an underlying lawsuit involving third party property damage or personal injury. Farmers insured the Kazis under a Farmers E-Z-Reader Car Policy that included a \"Comprehensive Personal Liability Insurance Endorsement\" providing liability coverage for \"damages which an insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of ... property damage resulting from an occurrence to which this coverage applies.\" The policy defined property damage as \"physical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use.\" The insurers did not intend these policies to cover disputes involving claims over intangible property rights.</p>\n<p>The Truck personal umbrella policy provided coverage for \"damages that you must pay ... because of personal injury ... covered by this policy; [and] reasonable expenses that you incur in the investigation, defense and settlement of a claim or suit because of personal injury or property damage covered by this policy....\" The policy defined personal injury to mean, in pertinent part, \"injury arising out of ... [\u00b6] ... wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of ... a person's right of private occupancy.... [\u00b6] Property damage means damage to or loss of use of tangible property.\" The State Farm homeowners liability insurance policy defined property damage to mean \"physical damage to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of use of this property.\" The policy's \"loss of use\" provision covered payment to maintain the insureds' own standard of living if the insured loss rendered the insureds'\"residence premises\" uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>Before the insurers responded to the demand for a defense, the Kazis settled the Tollakson action on the eve of trial in November 1990. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that the mutual common driveway alleged in the complaint did not exist. Instead the Kazis agreed to record a deeded easement in a portion of Parcel A to enable the Tollaksons to construct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> and maintain a separate driveway on Parcel B. The settlement agreement also gave the Kazis an option, at the Tollaksons' expense, to \"process a lot line adjustment\" so that the easement the Kazis granted to the Tollaksons would become part of Parcel B. Following the settlement, State Farm reimbursed the Kazis for the fees and costs it found reasonably attributable to the six-month defense and settlement.</p>\n<p>Not satisfied with the reimbursement, the Kazis filed the present bad faith action against their insurers, suing them for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent handling of their claim. The insurers' answer to the complaint asserted that they had no duty to defend or indemnify the Kazis in the underlying Tollakson lawsuit because it involved an easement dispute and their policies did not cover intangible property actions. Truck and Farmers also cross-complained against the Kazis in declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that they had no duty to defend the Kazis, that their policies provided no coverage for the Tollaksons' claims, and that they had no duty to indemnify the Kazis for their costs.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted State Farm's motion to sever the issues and try first the duty to defend question. It ruled in the insurers' favor, finding that because the easement dispute involved intangible property rights only, and no physical damage or occurrence on the Tollaksons' property, the complaint on its face did not trigger the duty to defend. The court added that the Tollaksons' complaint did not allege any claim for tangible property damage to Parcel B, and they therefore were not seeking the type of damages that were potentially covered under the liability insurance policies. It therefore granted the insurers' motion for nonsuit, concluding that they \"had no duty to defend the Kazis in the Tollakson action because there was no potential for coverage under any of the policies for personal injury or property damage.\" Based on its coverage conclusion, the court found no breach of contract and no breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court judgment. It acknowledged that easement rights are \"referred to as `intangible' rights,\" but stated that was not the case in insurance contracts. The court observed that an easement holder may not \"be able to see, hear, smell or touch [his] `right,'\" but concluded that an insured can physically transform an alleged implied easement from an intangible piece of property to a tangible form by obstructing access to it, or grading it, as the Kazis did here. The court held that the insurers had a duty to defend the Kazis against the Tollakson action because the Kazis' grading and paving a driveway on their own property, allegedly subject to an implied easement, amounted to more than a loss of use claim; it constituted property damage to tangible property under each of the Kazis' liability policies.</p>\n<p>In disagreeing with the trial court's interpretation of the complaint, the Court of Appeal also concluded \"that the Tollakson complaint against the insureds may be read to allege damage to Parcel B, owned in fee simple by the Tollaksons, and on this basis also gave rise to a duty to defend under [the Kazis'] insurance policies.\" In other words, the Court of Appeal believed the complaint alleged physical damage to Parcel B, in addition to obstruction of an implied easement over Parcel A.</p>\n<p>In justifying its conclusion, the Court of Appeal purported to distinguish <i>Gunderson,</i> which held that obstruction and loss of use of an alleged easement that reduced property value were not covered under a liability insurance policy's property damage provision. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal. App.4th at p. 1109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The Court of Appeal distinguished <i>Gunderson</i> on the ground that the plaintiff there sought only to quiet title in fee simple and did not allege the right to use and enjoy an easement. The court noted that the <i>Gunderson</i> complaint \"alleged nonphysical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> injuries, and did not allege any physical injury to or destruction of [the plaintiffs] property....\" We granted review to decide whether liability insurance policies that cover only tangible property loss could ever give rise to a duty to defend in a dispute involving intangible property rights, and whether the Court of Appeal's conclusion that they could conflicts with <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at page 1109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

An Insurer's Duty to Defend Claim for Loss to Intangible Property</h2>\n<p>A standard general liability insurer has a duty to defend and indemnify for a loss to tangible property only. The property loss section of these policies provides coverage for physical injury, loss, or destruction of tangible property, and the focus of the property damage coverage is the property itself.

In \"determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend, we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In <i>Waller,</i> emotional distress (bodily harm that that particular liability policy covered) flowed from the economic loss that the comprehensive liability policy did not cover.

There, we held that the insurer had no duty to defend.

Here, we consider whether the liability insurance policies potentially cover the source of the damages (loss of right-of-way) or the consequential damages (alleged devaluation and loss of rental value of Parcel B). (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>Our conclusion will rest on a determination whether the Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider the easement's legal meaning in light of the insurance contract. First, we look to the policies' definition of the term \"tangible property.\" \"Tangible property\" is not ambiguous, and coverage therefore does not turn on alternative meanings. Consistent with an insured's reasonable expectations, \"tangible property\" refers to things that can be touched, seen, and smelled. (See <i>Warner v. Fire Ins. Exchange</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></span>, 1034, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2114712\"><a href=\"/opinion/2114712/warner-v-fire-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>.) To construe tangible property as including a legal interest in an easement or in property \"requires a strained and farfetched interpretation.\" (<i>Giddings v. Industrial Indemnity Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span>, 219, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2140290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2140290/giddings-v-industrial-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>.) Instead, an easement is a nonpossessory \"`interest in the land of another that gives its owner the right to use the land of another or to prevent the property owner from using his land.'\" (<i>County Sanitation Dist. v. Watson Land Co.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></span>, 1278, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

An easement right is akin to goodwill, an anticipated benefit of a bargain, or an investment, none of which is considered tangible property. (<i>Giddings v. Industrial Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 112 Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>It is especially important to distinguish an easement right from fee simple property ownership. (See <i>Highland Realty Co. v. City of San Rafael</i> (1956) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></span>, 677-678, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>; <i>City of Long Beach v.

Fee simple title provides an owner \"the right to the surface and to everything permanently situated beneath or above it.\" (Civ.Code, \u00a7 829.) By contrast, an appurtenant easement is a burden on land that creates a right-of-way or the right to use the land only. (Civ.Code, \u00a7 801.) It represents a limited privilege to use the land of another for the benefit of the easement holder's land, but does not create an interest in the land itself. (<i>Camp Meeker Water System, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610909\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610909/camp-meeker-water-sys-inc-v-public-utilities-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span>, 865, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610909\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610909/camp-meeker-water-sys-inc-v-public-utilities-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(<i>City &amp; County of San Francisco v. Calderwood</i> (1867) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span>, 589-590; <i>Wood v.

Real Estate, Fixtures, \u00a7 17:3, pp. 7-8.) Being incorporeal, the right to an easement is limited to the intangible benefit of access to the easement holder's property. (<i>Fresno St. R. Co. v. Southern Pac. R. Co.</i> (1901) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3301713\"><a href=\"/opinion/3302489/fresno-etc-co-v-southern-pac-etc-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3301713\"><a href=\"/opinion/3302489/fresno-etc-co-v-southern-pac-etc-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>.) In other words, it is an intangible legal right. The owner of the dominant tenement may maintain an action for the enforcement of this intangible right and may recover damages from a party for obstructing the easement. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 809; <i>Moylan v. Dykes</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span> </a></span>(<i>Moylan</i>).) Awardable damages compensate the plaintiff for loss of use of the easement and the diminished value of the lot it benefited. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123613\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123613/moylan-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Moylan,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 181 Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>.) The ability to recover damages for obstruction of an easement, however, does not change the intangible nature of the property right for purposes of interpreting insurance liability coverage. (See <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>As a matter of law, therefore, an easement, representing only a nonpossessory right to use another's property, is not tangible property. As we will conclude, any damages the Tollaksons claimed were for economic loss due to loss of use of the easement. We will therefore conclude that the several liability insurance policies before us provided the Kazis with no potential coverage, and therefore no duty to defend, the Tollaksons' claim for intangible losses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Case Law and Easement Property Rights</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Gunderson</h2>\n<p>In <i>Gunderson,</i> the Court of Appeal concluded that disputes involving the loss of use of an easement or obstruction of an easement involve only \"pure rights in property\" or intangible rights in property. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) <i>Gunderson</i> held that a homeowners liability insurance policy did not require the insurer to defend or indemnify the insureds in an easement action because there was no claim of a tangible property loss. (<i>Ibid.</i>) The insureds in <i>Gunderson</i> purchased land believing they owned an easement. The plaintiff, who owned the servient estate, filed a complaint to quiet title, for declaratory relief, for fee title, and for injunctive relief to enjoin the insureds from using her property. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1110, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The defendants tendered the defense to their liability insurer, which had issued a homeowners liability insurance policy that defined property damage to include \"`physical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1117, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The insurer refused to defend the action on the ground that the complaint alleged no tangible property damage, excusing it from any defense obligation. (<i>Ibid.</i>) The trial court agreed with the insurer. It concluded that the undisputed facts established no ambiguity in the complaint to alert the insurer to a duty to defend. In disputes involving the right to use or obstruction of an easement, an intangible property right, it found no potential for coverage under the liability insurance policy. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1112, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>On appeal, the insureds claimed potential insurance coverage existed on a loss of use theory. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal. App.4th at p. 1117, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) According to the insureds' theory, if the plaintiff in the underlying easement action had lost, her land would have been encumbered by an easement that would have restricted her use of her tangible property. (<i>Ibid.</i>) The <i>Gunderson</i> court, however, disagreed with the insureds and affirmed the trial court decision. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The court reasoned that the plaintiffs failure to allege physical damage to any tangible property that sat on the alleged easement (e.g., to a fence that crossed the property) eliminated any claim for a tangible property loss that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> would have given rise to a potential for liability coverage. (<i>Ibid.</i>) <i>Gunderson</i> emphasized that a dispute over use of an easement, always considered intangible property, simply did not involve damage to tangible property. (<i>Ibid.</i>) The court observed that the lawsuit \"alleged only nonphysical injuries from the [plaintiffs] assertion of adverse claims to the easement, including depreciation of the value of [the plaintiffs] property.... `\"Understood in its plain and ordinary sense, `tangible property' means `property (as real estate) having physical substance apparent to the senses' [citation]. To construe the explicit words `tangible property' to include intangible economic interests and property rights requires a strained and farfetched interpretation, doing violence to the plain language of the policies. Such an interpretation would rewrite the policies to fasten on the insurers a liability they have not assumed.\" [Citations.]' Thus, pure rights in property, such as those claimed to have been lost by [the plaintiff] in her underlying complaint, are by definition not the kind of physical damage or injury to tangible property necessary to trigger coverage under the Policy provisions. [Citation.]\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) Other states that have considered the question have also concluded that general liability insurance policies do not provide coverage for intangible property loss. (See, e.g., <i>Columbia Nat. Ins. v. Pacesetter Homes, Inc.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 6, 8; <i>Guelich v.

The Court of Appeal's application of Gunderson</h2>\n<p>As noted (<i>ante,</i> 103 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 6, 14 P.3d at p. 227), the Court of Appeal here attempted to distinguish <i>Gunderson</i> on the ground that the underlying complaint in that case \"did not allege any physical injury to or destruction of [the underlying plaintiffs] property, as was required to trigger coverage by the definition of `property damage' in the subject policy.\" The Court of Appeal concluded that unlike the <i>Gunderson</i> complaint, the Tollaksons' complaint alleged that \"the Kazis' act of paving the driveway in such a way as to render the land impassable and unusable to the Tollaksons constituted physical injury or damage, just as if the Kazis had dug a hole or erected a fence across the land.\" The Court of Appeal believed that the \"`pure rights in property' claimed to have been lost by [the <i>Gunderson</i> plaintiff] in her complaint were to hold her property in fee simple, free of any easement, and to be free of the insured's use of her property which she claimed caused her property to depreciate. It was these rights, and not the right to the use and enjoyment of an easement, which the <i>Gunderson</i> court pronounced to be `intangible economic interests and property rights' and not within the definition of `tangible property.' ... ([<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i>] 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1117-1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.)\"</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal misapplied <i>Gunderson's</i> rule. The <i>Gunderson</i> court did note that if the plaintiff had alleged physical property damage (e.g., to a fence or other physical property standing on the alleged easement), the insurer might or might not have had a duty to defend the insureds in an action for that actual physical damage. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal. App.4th at p. 1109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The court did not decide the issue, however, because there were no allegations involving damage to tangible property in that case. (<i>Ibid.</i>) Contrary to the Court of Appeal's position, <i>Gunderson</i> did not hold that allegations of physical damage to land burdened by an easement (or other intangible property interest) would give rise to a duty to defend or indemnify for loss of use or obstruction of the easement. The liability insurance policy in <i>Gunderson,</i> as here, required that the complaint allege damage to <i>tangible</i> property in order to trigger a duty to defend or indemnify the claimed loss. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> Thus, the Kazis' grading a driveway over their own Parcel A and the 10-foot strip they owned that was subject to an easement dispute did not change the nature of the underlying Tollakson action into an action for tangible property loss. Grading over the insureds' own land that may have been subject to an implied easement did not change the <i>easement's</i> intangible nature, nor could it ever change the character of the easement right-of-way the Tollaksons claimed. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) It is the nature of the easement right that was at issue, not the physicalities that may relate to it. (<i>Ibid.</i>) As <i>Gunderson</i> made clear, a loss of \"pure rights in property\" is not the physical damage or injury to tangible property required to trigger a duty to defend or indemnify under general liability insurance policies.</p>\n<p>Because an easement interest conveys no property rights to the land subject to the easement, it exists only to benefit the easement holder's property. Interference with an easement frustrates the right of access by the easement holder to the burdened property, regardless of the method used to obstruct it, i.e., whether the easement is cordoned off or is physically damaged. In either case, the remedy is the same: the plaintiff must request that the obstruction be removed. (<i>Scruby v. Vintage Grapevine, Inc.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span>, 703, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span>.) The damages are also the same in either case: the dominant estate's loss of rental value and diminished property value, or loss of the easement's fair market value. In neither case, however, may an easement holder sue for damages to the underlying property, which the owner of the servient estate holds in fee title.</p>\n<p>Decisions in analogous situations support this conclusion. In <i>Schaefer/Karpf Productions v. CNA Ins. Companies</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></span>, 1319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280175\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280175/schaeferkarpf-productions-v-cna-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, the Court of Appeal held that the comprehensive general liability insurance policy did not provide coverage for the plaintiffs losses. There, the insured videotape duplication company had inadvertently copied the plaintiff television producer's family special, <i>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,</i> onto used cassette videotapes containing pornography. Unfortunately, the family special was shorter than the pornography, when viewed by purchasers of videotapes of the plaintiffs television show. The plaintiff asserted that its resulting lost profits were due to the damaged tapes, which were tangible property (the insurance policy covered \"damage to tangible property\"). (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1317, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280175\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280175/schaeferkarpf-productions-v-cna-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>.) The Court of Appeal disagreed, reasoning that the plaintiffs damages did not flow from a physical injury to the tapes, but from the injury to the plaintiffs concept of a story about a Christmas pageant, which was intangible property. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1316, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280175\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280175/schaeferkarpf-productions-v-cna-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>.) Similarly, here the damages did not flow from any injury to the land, but from the alleged injury to the Tollaksons' right to an easement over Parcel A, which is intangible.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lucker Mfg. v. Home Ins. Co.</i> (3d Cir.1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669673\"><a href=\"/opinion/669673/lucker-manufacturing-a-unit-of-amclyde-engineered-products-inc-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 810 (<i>Lucker</i>), the circuit court held that the design concept for a product was not tangible property under a comprehensive general liability insurance policy. The insured's actions caused the plaintiff to have to revise its design plans. The circuit court agreed with the carrier that where the real value of a design is in the idea, not in the physical plans that memorialize that idea, any loss in value of the design represents a loss in value of the idea, which is intangible. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 812-813.) <i>Lucker</i> reasoned that \"none of the losses Lucker sought from [the insured] represented a loss in value of the storage medium in which the design ... was embodied.... The recovery Lucker sought was for the loss of use of the design itself.... For this reason, we hold that Lucker's loss of use of the ... design was not loss of use of tangible property.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 820.) Similarly here, the alleged loss in value of the Tollaksons' property was from the loss of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the use of the easement over the Kazis' property, not damage to the physical medium, or the property itself. The real harm was the loss of use, which is intangible.</p>\n<p>In <i>Waller,</i> we held that intangible economic losses, which fell outside the liability policy coverage, caused the emotional trauma that investors suffered. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Waller,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 11 Cal.4th at p. 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We stated that \"it is widely understood by both insureds and insurers that such policies are not intended to cover economic losses.... [T]he damages alleged in [the underlying] complaint flowed from intangible property losses....\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Like <i>Waller,</i> here the damages flow from an intangible loss\u0097loss of use. Again, no damages are claimed, or could be claimed, for the loss of value to the underlying land itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Actual physical damage to Parcel B</h2>\n<p>The Kazis also persuaded the Court of Appeal that the Tollaksons' complaint alleged actual physical damage to the Tollaksons' own Parcel B. Indeed, the Court of Appeal erroneously interpreted the underlying complaint to allege that the Kazis had graded and trespassed on Parcel B, as well as on the land on Parcel A subject to the claimed easement. Grading and trespassing on the neighbors' land would certainly seem to be \"property damage\" under the terms of the liability policies and would, if true, probably have triggered coverage independent of the intangible property issue discussed above, at least as to the trespass and ejectment causes of action.</p>\n<p>As the insurers observe, however, the Tollaksons' complaint alleged only the intention to convert the 10-foot strip on the Kazis' own Parcel A. In other words, the only property loss claimed in the Tollakson lawsuit was that the Kazis were interfering with the Tollaksons' ability to use an easement across Kazis' own property. Nonetheless, because the Tollaksons alleged that the Kazis graded Parcel A and obstructed Parcel B's right-of-way over the \"Common Driveway Easement,\" the Kazis convinced the Court of Appeal that the Tollaksons were actually seeking to recover for physical injury to Parcel B. In turn, the Court of Appeal reasoned that the Tollaksons' complaint stated a claim that was potentially covered under the Kazis' liability insurance policies indemnifying third party property damage and personal injury.</p>\n<p>As a plain reading of the Tollaksons' underlying complaint reveals, and as defendant insurers correctly assert, however, the only property in dispute in the Tollakson lawsuit was the 10-foot strip of property on Parcel A where the Kazis built an access road to their building site in the vicinity of the Tollaksons' property boundary line. The Tollaksons' complaint alleged that the Kazis' grading of the 10-foot strip of property on Parcel A which was subject to an implied common driveway easement to Parcel B, obstructed it and interfered with their right to use Parcel A as a right-of-way to Parcel B. Nowhere did the complaint allege any physical damage to the Tollaksons' parcel, including that parcel's 10-foot strip of property that would have constituted the other half of the implied easement.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the complaint's actual words illustrate the Court of Appeal's error. As defendant insurers observe, the Tollaksons' complaint alleged only a loss of use of their implied easement over the Kazis' Parcel A as follows: \"[The Tollaksons] claim that there exists upon Parcel A an implied easement for a common driveway, for ingress, egress, and a right of way over and across Parcel A, parallel to the Boundary Line and for a width of not less than ten feet (the Disputed Property), all of which is appurtenant to Parcel B, and that Parcel B is the dominant tenement and Parcel A the servient tenement of such easement (hereinafter `the Common Driveway Easement').\"</p>\n<p>Thus, under the Tollakson complaint, the term \"Disputed Property\" referred to the 10-foot strip of land the Kazis owned in fee simple. In addition, the complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> defined the term \"Common Driveway Easement\" to refer to the Tollaksons' easement or right-of-way over that \"Disputed Property.\" Therefore, the Tollakson complaint's definition of the \"Common Driveway Easement\" included only a portion of Parcel A\u0097the Kazis' property\u0097and in no way included any portion of Parcel B. When the Tollaksons complained that the grading of Parcel A interfered with the \"entirety of the Common Driveway Easement,\" they were complaining that the Kazis' grading and construction involved Parcel A only and did not involve trespass on or destruction of any part of Parcel B. Even the trespass and ejectment allegations involved loss of use and occupation of the 10-foot strip of land that is part of Parcel A, or the Kazis' half of the alleged implied easement.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, the Tollaksons' fundamental loss at stake here was their right to use the implied easement over Parcel A and the alleged harm they suffered because of that loss of use. The law is clear, however, that in order to trigger a duty to defend, the Tollaksons had to allege that their own physical property, including the 10-foot strip of land on their parcel that was arguably subject to an implied easement for a right-of-way, was damaged when the Kazis graded their property. Their complaint made no allegations of damage to Parcel B, and hence, there was no possibility of liability coverage for third party property damage in this lawsuit. The Court of Appeal erred in distinguishing <i>Gunderson</i> from the Tollakson action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As the <i>Gunderson</i> court held, a loss of \"pure rights in property\" is not physical damage or injury to tangible property that triggers a duty to defend under a comprehensive liability insurance policy that provides coverage only for such losses. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>.) The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the Kazis' grading of a 10-foot strip of property on their land, which was allegedly subject to an implied easement for a common driveway, constituted property damage to tangible property under the applicable liability insurance policies, giving rise to a potential for coverage and requiring the insurers to defend the Kazis in the Tollakson action. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeal judgment to the extent it is inconsistent with the above reasoning, and remand the action for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>GEORGE, C.J., MOSK, J., KENNARD, J., BAXTER, J., WERDEGAR, J., and BROWN, J., concur.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  By court order, we specifically limited review to (1) whether interference with an easement right is property damage to tangible property giving rise to a duty to defend, and whether the Court of Appeal's decision conflicts with <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gunderson,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span>; and (2) whether the Court of Appeal correctly characterized part of the underlying action as involving physical property damage.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court of Appeal's conclusion that there was physical damage to the Tollaksons' property was premised on its misunderstanding about the meaning of the \"Common Driveway Easement.\" The Court of Appeal reasoned that \"by alleging that the encroachment and trespass by the Kazis' `cover[ed] all or a portion of the Disputed Property ... and the entirety of the Common Driveway Easement,' the Tollakson complaint alleged property damage to the Tollaksons' land, Parcel B, giving rise to potential coverage under all of the insurance policies at issue here and requiring the insurers to defend the Kazis in the Tollakson lawsuit.... Whatever its deficiencies, the Tollaksons' pleading stated facts sufficient to demonstrate the Kazis had damaged their possessory and nonpossessory interests in their real property.\" But, as defendant insurers observe, and as we have consistently noted, the Tollaksons did not seek to resolve any dispute over the portion of their Parcel B which they, in fact, acknowledged in the complaint was subject to an implied easement for the Kazis' use. The definitional terms made this clear, and, as we have explained, the rest of the complaint supports this reading.\n</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal also relied extensively on deposition testimony hinting that the Tollaksons' attorney initially explored suing the Kazis for interference with Parcel B. But, as the record shows, the attorney admitted that the Tollaksons were \"only claiming an easement here,\" or a right to use Parcel A. The attorney's comment is supported by the face of the complaint, which did not allege that the Kazis physically trespassed onto the Tollaksons' property.</p>\n\n</div>",

The motions for summary judgment with which we are concerned produced a voluminous record, which fills more than 18,400 pages. They arose out of extensive discovery, which yielded, according to one tally, more than 100 depositions, 1,500 interrogatories, 135 requests for admissions, 900 requests for the production of documents, and 500,000 pages of documents in response to such requests.</p>\n<p>But because our review focuses on the law that courts must apply in ruling on motions for summary judgment in all actions including the present, and not on the application of such law in this particular one, we need not state the facts in detail and at length. For our purposes, the following synopsis will suffice.</p>\n<p>The Legislature has found and declared that the \"petroleum industry is an essential element of the California economy and is therefore of vital importance to the health and welfare of all Californians.\" (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 25350, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*852</span> In 1991, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations requiring the sale in this state of a new, cleaner burning, but more expensive formulation of gasoline\u0097 CARB gasoline\u0097beginning in 1996. In 1991, the state's market for gasoline was oligopolistic, that is, it was served by a few large firms, including as major participants the petroleum companies that figure here. Although the gasoline used in the state was not unique, the state itself was relatively isolated. Each of the petroleum companies faced decisions of substantial magnitude and difficulty with respect to CARB gasoline capacity, production, and pricing. In arriving at its own decisions and then following through, each had to make great capital expenditures, from a low of about $100 million to a high of more than $1 billion. In 1996, the state's market for gasoline was even more oligopolistic, being served by even fewer large firms, including as dominant participants the petroleum companies that figure here. The state itself remained relatively isolated. But, now, the gasoline used in the state was unique. The price of CARB gasoline, once introduced, moved generally upward across all of the petroleum companies more or less together, rising quickly and falling slowly. Subsequent state and federal investigations expressly or impliedly attributed the generally upward price movement of CARB gasoline to various market forces, including the higher cost of its production, the higher cost of crude oil from which it was produced, higher demand, lower inventories, unplanned production outages, and higher taxes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>On June 7,1996, on behalf of herself and all other retail consumers of CARB gasoline, Aguilar filed an unverified complaint, with a demand for trial by jury, against the petroleum companies in the Superior Court of San Diego County. In the complaint, as subsequently amended into its operative form, she alleged facts for a primary cause of action for violation of section 1 of the Cartwright Act (Stats. 1907, ch. 530, \u00a7 1, pp. 984-985, as amended, Bus. &amp; Prof.Code, \u00a7 16720 et seq.), which is analogous to section 1 of the Sherman Act (Act of July 2, 1890, ch. 647, \u00a7 1, <span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Stat. 209</span>, as amended, <span class=\"citation no-link\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1</span>), asserting in substance that the petroleum companies had entered into an unlawful conspiracy to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price\u0097 specifically, a conspiracy among competitors that is unlawful per se without regard to any of its effects. She also alleged facts for a derivative cause of action for violation of the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), asserting in substance that the conspiracy in question, even if not unlawful under the Cartwright Act, was unlawful at least under the unfair competition law itself.</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies each answered, denying all of the allegations referred to above.</p>\n<p>Later, the petroleum companies each moved the superior court for summary judgment. In support, they each presented evidence including declarations by officers or managers or similar employees with responsibility in the premises, generally stating on personal knowledge how the company made its capacity, production, and pricing decisions about CARB gasoline, asserting that it did so independently, and denying that it did so collusively with any of the others. Aguilar opposed the motions. In support, she presented evidence including the companies' gathering and dissemination of capacity, production, and pricing information, through the independently owned and operated Oil Price Information Service, or OPIS, and otherwise; their use of common consultants; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*853</span> and, perhaps most prominently, their execution of exchange agreements\u0097under which, for example, two companies may trade, with or without a price differential, products of the same type in different geographical areas and/or at different times <i>or</i> products of different types in the same geographical area and/or at the same time\u0097including any consequent activity, or lack of activity, in the spot market, where individual wholesale bulk sales and purchases are transacted. She also presented related evidence in the form of opinion by experts.</p>\n<p>After a hearing, the superior court issued an order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. It caused entry thereof. It specified its reasons at length and in detail, filling 24 pages, to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies carried their burden of persuasion to show that there was no triable issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>Particularly, as to Aguilar's Cartwright Act cause of action, which was primary, the petroleum companies carried an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy through the declarations that they presented from their officers and managers and similar employees in light of <i>Biljac Associates v. First Interstate Bank</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">218 Cal.App.3d 1410</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">267 Cal.Rptr. 819</span> (hereafter sometimes <i>Biljac</i>), which dealt with the force and effect of similar declarations as to a similar cause of action by certain commercial borrowers against certain banks and bank trade associations. Aguilar did not carry a burden of production, which had shifted onto her shoulders, to make a prima facie showing of her own of the presence of an unlawful conspiracy through any of the evidence that she presented, including that of capacity, production, and pricing information, common consultants, or exchange agreements, or her own experts' opinion. \"[T]he <i>only</i> logical inference which can be drawn\" from Aguilar's evidence, even after it has been \"examin[ed] ... in its entirety and without compartmentalization,\" is that the \"actions\" of the petroleum companies \"were a pro-competitive response to a regulatory requirement which forced members of an oligopoly to restructure their product mix and incur substantial additional capital expenditures.\" (Italics added in place of underscoring in original.) Aguilar had \"attempted to weave\" a \"complex, tangled web\" of unlawful conspiracy. Her evidence, however, \"suggest[ed]\" only individual companies \"using all available information sources to determine capacity, supply, and pricing decisions which would maximize their own individual profits\u0097without regard to the profits of their competitors\"\u0097and did \"not support even the inference of such a conspiracy.</p>\n<p>As to Aguilar's unfair competition law cause of action, which was derivative, the petroleum companies, as indicated, carried their initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy; Aguilar, as also indicated, did not carry her shifted burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful one.</p>\n<p>The superior court rendered judgment in accordance with its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment, and caused entry thereof.</p>\n<p>Aguilar moved the superior court for a new trial. In so doing, she challenged its judgment by challenging as erroneous its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. Specifically, among her grounds for a new trial was a claim that, in granting summary judgment as to her Cartwright Act cause of action, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*854</span> made an \"error in law\" in reading and applying <i>Biljac</i> as it did.</p>\n<p>After a hearing, the superior court issued an order granting a new trial. In so doing, it recognized that Aguilar had challenged its judgment by challenging as erroneous its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. It granted a new trial on the sole ground that, in granting summary judgment as to her Cartwright Act cause of action, it did indeed make an \"error in law.\" In specifying its reasons, it stated that it did in fact misread and misapply <i>Biljac</i> to allow the petroleum companies to carry their initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy as to her Cartwright Act cause of action by presenting evidence <i>other than</i> through declarations by each person responsible within each company for its capacity, production, and pricing decisions about CARB gasoline: it now read and applied <i>Biljac</i> to require declarations by each such person. Its order granting a new trial effectively vacated its judgment. Hence, it operated like an order denying summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies each filed a notice of appeal in the superior court from its order granting a new trial. For her part, Aguilar filed a notice of cross-appeal from the judgment rendered and entered following the order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies' appeals and Aguilar's cross-appeal were docketed in the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District under the same number, and were assigned as a single matter to Division One.</p>\n<p>Aguilar moved the Court of Appeal to dismiss the petroleum companies' appeals. She claimed, inter alia, that it had not been presented with any appealable judgment or order over which it could assert jurisdiction. It issued an order denying her motion in summary fashion.</p>\n<p>In a unanimous opinion, the Court of Appeal reversed the superior court's order granting a new trial, and remanded the cause to the superior court with directions to issue an order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment and, impliedly, to render judgment accordingly and cause entry thereof.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal's opinion is lengthy and detailed, even more so than the superior court's specification of reasons for its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. The opinion proper fills 118 pages, plus seven appendices themselves filling 18 pages.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal applied the independent standard of review to the superior court's order granting a new trial, which the superior court predicated on the asserted erroneousness of its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment.</p>\n<p>Applying the independent standard of review, the Court of Appeal concluded that the superior court's order granting a new trial was erroneous because it concluded that the superior court's order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment was not.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal concluded that the petroleum companies carried their burden of persuasion to show that there was no triable issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*855</span> The Court of Appeal determined that, as to Aguilar's Cartwright Act cause of action, the petroleum companies carried their burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy, but Aguilar did not carry her shifted burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful one, her \"evidence\" often being less than it was claimed to be. The Court of Appeal accepted the superior court's earlier determination that Aguilar's evidence did \"not support even the inference of an unlawful conspiracy, but only individual, \"pro-competitive\" \"actions.\" But the Court of Appeal rejected the superior court's later determination that it made an error in law in its reading and application of <i>Biljac,</i> finding no support therein for any requirement that the petroleum companies had to present evidence in the form of declarations by each person responsible within each company for its capacity, production, and pricing decisions about CARB gasoline.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal determined that, as to Aguilar's unfair competition law cause of action, the petroleum companies, as indicated, carried their burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy, but Aguilar, as also indicated, did not carry her shifted burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful one.</p>\n<p>Aguilar petitioned for review. We granted her application. We now affirm.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Our task in this cause is to clarify the law that courts must apply in ruling on motions for summary judgment, both in actions generally and specifically in antitrust actions for unlawful conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute. (E.g., <i>Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn.</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">46 Cal.3d 1092</span>, 1107, <span class=\"citation no-link\">252 Cal.Rptr. 122</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">762 P.2d 46</span>.)</p>\n<p>Under summary judgment law, any party to an action, whether plaintiff or defendant, \"may move\" the court \"for summary judgment\" in his favor on a cause of action (i.e., claim) or defense (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (a))\u0097a plaintiff \"contending] ... that there is no defense to the action,\" a defendant \"contend[ing] that the action has no merit\" (<i>ibid.).</i> The court must \"grant[ ]\" the \"motion\" \"if all the papers submitted show\" that \"there is no triable issue as to any material fact\" (<i>id.,</i> \u00a7 437c, subd. (c))\u0097that is, there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and, ultimately, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*856</span> the law (see <i>Riverside County Community Facilities Dist. v. Bainbridge 17</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation no-link\">77 Cal.App.4th 644</span>, 653, <span class=\"citation no-link\">92 Cal. Rptr.2d 29</span>; <i>Kelly v.

The moving party must \"support[ ]\" the \"motion\" with evidence including \"affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice\" must or may \"be taken.\" (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 437c, subd.

Likewise, any adverse party may oppose the motion, and, \"where appropriate,\" must present evidence including \"affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice\" must or may \"be taken.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>) An adverse party who chooses to oppose the motion must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to do so. (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 437c, subd. (h).) In ruling on the motion, the court must \"consider all of the evidence\" and \"all\" of the \"inferences\" reasonably drawn therefrom (<i>id.,</i> \u00a7 437c, subd. (c)), and must view such evidence (e.g., <i>Molko v.

Initially, the moving party bears a burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any genuine issue of material fact. If he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift: the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. How each party may carry his burden of persuasion and/or production depends on <i>which</i> would bear <i>what</i> burden of proof at trial. Thus, if a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment, he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not. By contrast, if a defendant moves for summary judgment against such a plaintiff, he may present evidence that would require such a trier of fact <i>not</i> to find any underlying material fact more likely than not. In the alternative, he may simply point out\u0097he is not required to present evidence (see Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., rule 56(b), 28 U.S.C.)\u0097 that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence that would allow such a trier of fact to find any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*858</span> underlying material fact more likely than not.</p>\n<p>For itself, <i>Matsushita</i> operates within the specific context of an antitrust action for unlawful conspiracy under provisions including section 1 of the Sherman Act, which makes a conspiracy among competitors to restrict output and/or raise prices unlawful per se (see, e.g., <i>U.S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.</i> (1940) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103352\"><a href=\"/opinion/103352/united-states-v-socony-vacuum-oil-co/\">310 U.S. 150</a></span>, 218, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103352\"><a href=\"/opinion/103352/united-states-v-socony-vacuum-oil-co/\">60 S.Ct. 811</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">84 L.Ed. 1129</span>).</p>\n<p><i>Matsushita's</i> scenario is this: A plaintiffs antitrust claim asserts an unlawful conspiracy on the part of the defendants. The defendants move for summary judgment on the ground that there is no genuine issue of the material fact of the existence of an unlawful conspiracy. At trial, the plaintiff would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence on the unlawful-conspiracy issue. The defendants carry their burden of production to make a prima facie showing that the unlawful-conspiracy issue is not genuine. The plaintiff is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing that it is. In order to carry his burden of production, the plaintiff must present evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find in his favor on the unlawful-conspiracy issue by a preponderance of the evidence, that is, to find an unlawful conspiracy more likely than not.</p>\n<p>According to <i>Matsushita,</i> \"ambiguous evidence\" showing \"conduct\" that is \"as consistent with permissible competition\" by independent actors \"as with illegal conspiracy\" by colluding ones is insufficient. (<i>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

The court would indeed have to view inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

(<i>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

Specifically, such law renders ambiguous evidence or inferences insufficient. If it did not, it might effectively \"chill\" \"procompetitive conduct\" in the world at large, the very thing that it is \"designed to protect,\" by subjecting it to undue costs in the judicial sphere. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 593-594, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\">106 S.Ct. 1348</a></span>.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, concludes <i>Matsushita,</i> in addition to ambiguous evidence or inferences, the plaintiff \"must present evidence `that <i>tends</i> to exclude'\"\u0097although it need not <i>actually</i> exclude\u0097\"`the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently\" rather than collusively. (<i>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

Even though the defendants' \"state of mind is at issue\" and a trier of fact \"might disbelieve\" their \"denial of a conspiracy,\" the plaintiff may not make it to trial \"by merely asserting\" that a reasonable trier of fact \"might, and legally could, disbelieve\" their denial \"without offering any concrete evidence from which\" such a trier of fact could find in his favor: \"`[Discredited testimony is not [normally] considered a sufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion.'\" (<i>Anderson v.

Columbia Broadcasting</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106334\"><a href=\"/opinion/106334/poller-v-columbia-broadcasting-system-inc/\">368 U.S. 464</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106334\"><a href=\"/opinion/106334/poller-v-columbia-broadcasting-system-inc/\">82 S.Ct. 486</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106334\"><a href=\"/opinion/106334/poller-v-columbia-broadcasting-system-inc/\">7 L.Ed.2d 458</a></span>. In <i>Poller,</i> the Supreme Court had expressed a belief that courts should grant motions for summary judgment by defendants \"sparingly\" in complex antitrust actions for unlawful conspiracy under provisions including section 1 of the Sherman Act. (<i>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106334\"><a href=\"/opinion/106334/poller-v-columbia-broadcasting-system-inc/\">supra,</a></span></i> 368 U.S. at p. 473, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106334\"><a href=\"/opinion/106334/poller-v-columbia-broadcasting-system-inc/\">82 S.Ct. 486</a></span>.) But, after <i>Matsushita,</i> for courts to grant such motions \"sparingly\" does <i>not</i> mean \"seldom if ever.\" (<i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra</i><i>, All</i> U.S. at p. 256, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\">106 S.Ct. 2505</a></span>.) Rather, at appropriate times, they should indeed grant them and bring matters to an end. (See <i>id.</i> at p. 255,<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\">106 S.Ct. 2505</a></span>.)</p>\n<p>At the time of <i>Celotex, Anderson,</i> and <i>Matsushita,</i> summary judgment law in this state differed from its federal counterpart in various particulars, and was more restrictive of the granting of such motions as a result. For example, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment had to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of his own cause of action. (E.g., <i>Hayward Union etc. School Dist. v. Madrid</i> (1965) <span class=\"citation no-link\">234 Cal. App.2d 100</span>, 120, <span class=\"citation no-link\">44 Cal.Rptr. 268</span>.) For his part, a defendant moving for summary judgment had to \"conclusively negate\"\u0097to quote the potentially misleading phrase\u0097 an element of the plaintiffs cause of action. (E.g., <i>Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn., supra,</i> 46 Cal.3d at p. 1107, <span class=\"citation no-link\">252 Cal.Rptr. 122</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">762 P.2d 46</span>.) To do so, the defendant had to present evidence, and not simply point out that the plaintiff did not possess, and could not reasonably obtain, needed evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b), as amended by Stats.1984, ch. 171, \u00a7 1, p. 545.)</p>\n<p>In the wake of <i>Celotex, Anderson,</i> and <i>Matsushita,</i> as we recently noted in <i>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc.</i> (2000) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">24 Cal.4th 317</a></span>, 335, footnote 7, <span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352</span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">8 P.3d 1089</a></span> (hereafter sometimes <i>Guz</i>), summary judgment law has been amended, most significantly in 1992 and 1993, through Assembly Bill No. 2616 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) and Assembly Bill No. 498 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.), respectively.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The purpose of the 1992 amendment was \"to move summary judgment law\" in this state \"closer\" to its \"federal\" counterpart as clarified in <i>Celotex, Anderson,</i> and <i>Matsushita,</i> in order to liberalize the granting of such motions. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 498 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 11, 1993, p. 4.)<sup>[7]</sup> The purpose <span class=\"star-pagination\">*860</span> of the 1993 amendment was to move it even closer. (See Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 498 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 11, 1993, p. 4.)<sup>[8]</sup> Behind each of these amendments, <i>Celotex</i> figured prominently. Albeit less prominently, <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Matsushita</i> figured as well.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Together, the 1992 and 1993 amendments, which continue in effect to this day, have \"`changed'\"summary judgment law\" `dramatically.'\" (<i>Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400</i> (2001) <span class=\"citation no-link\">25 Cal.4th 763</span>, 768, <span class=\"citation no-link\">107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 P.3d 1143</span>, quoting <i>Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Construction Co.</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Cal.App.4th 64</span>, 70, <span class=\"citation no-link\">81 Cal. Rptr.2d 360</span>; accord, <i>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v.

Rptr.2d 821</span> [speaking specifically of the 1993 amendment]; see, e.g., <i>Villa v. McFerren</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">35 Cal.App.4th 733</span>, 752, fn. 8, <span class=\"citation no-link\">41 Cal.Rptr.2d 719</span> [referring specifically to the 1992 amendment].) As follows:</p>\n<p>In moving for summary judgment, a \"plaintiff ... has met\" his \"burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if he \"has proved each element of the cause of action entitling\" him \"to judgment on that cause of action. Once the plaintiff ... has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The defendant ... may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials\" of his \"pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead,\" must \"set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (<i>o</i>)(D.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, in moving for summary judgment, a \"defendant ... has met\" his \"burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he \"has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant ... has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The plaintiff ... may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials\" of his \"pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead,\" must \"set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).)</p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing, we believe that summary judgment law in this state now conforms, largely but not completely, to its federal counterpart as clarified and liberalized in <i>Celotex, Anderson,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*861</span> and <i>Matsushita.</i> The language added by the 1992 and 1993 amendments, which follows the substance of those decisions, supports our view. The legislative history of the bills that would result in those amendments provides confirmation, making plain that they \"follow\" their \"example.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2616 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 12,1992, p. 9.)<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>First, and generally, from commencement to conclusion, the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<sup>[11]</sup> That is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court's action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon. (See Evid.Code, \u00a7 500.) There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.<sup>[12]</sup> In <i>Reader's Digest Assn. v. Superior Court</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">37 Cal.3d 244</span>, 252, <span class=\"citation no-link\">208 Cal.Rptr. 137</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">690 P.2d 610</span> (hereafter sometimes <i>Reader's Digest),</i> we held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial were crucial for purposes of summary judgment, expressly as to the burden's placement and impliedly as to its quantum. There is nothing contrary in the language or legislative history of the 1992 and 1993 amendments. Thus, a plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion that \"each element of the \"cause of action\" in question has been \"proved,\" and hence that \"there is no defense\" thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (<i>o</i>)(1).) A defendant bears the burden of persuasion that \"one or more elements of the \"cause of action\" in question \"cannot be established,\" or that \"there is a complete defense\" thereto. (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).)</p>\n<p>Second, and generally, the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima <span class=\"star-pagination\">*862</span> facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact. Although not expressly, the 1992 and 1993 amendments impliedly provide in this regard for a burden of <i>production</i><sup>[13]</sup> as opposed to a burden of <i>persuasion. A</i> burden of production entails only the presentation of \"evidence.\" (Evid.Code, \u00a7 110.) A burden of persuasion, however, entails the \"establish[ment]\" through such evidence of a \"requisite degree of belief.\" (<i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 115.) It would make little, if any, sense to allow for the shifting of a burden of persuasion. For if the moving party carries a burden of persuasion, the opposing party can do nothing other than concede. Further, although not expressly, the 1992 and 1993 amendments impliedly provide for a burden of production <i>to make a prima facie showing.</i><sup>[14]</sup> A prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question. (Cf. Evid.Code, \u00a7 602 [stating that a \"statute providing that a fact or group of facts is prima facie evidence of another fact establishes a rebuttable presumption\"].) No more is called for.</p>\n<p>Third, and generally, how the parties moving for, and opposing, summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion and/or production depends on <i>which</i> would bear <i>what</i> burden of proof at trial. Again, in <i>Reader's Digest,</i> we held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial were crucial for purposes of summary judgment. (<i>Reader's Digest Assn. v. Superior Court, supra,</i> 37 Cal.3d at p. 252, <span class=\"citation no-link\">208 Cal.Rptr. 137</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">690 P.2d 610</span>.) In the legislative history, if not the quoted language, of the 1992 and 1993 amendments, there is support for such a proposition; in neither is there anything contrary.<sup>[15]</sup> Thus, if a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment, he must present evidence that would <i>require</i> a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not\u0097otherwise, he would not be entitled to judgment <i>as a matter of law,</i> but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact. By contrast, if a defendant moves for summary judgment against such a plaintiff, he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact <i>not</i> to find any underlying material fact more likely than not\u0097otherwise, <i>he</i> would not be entitled to judgment as <i>a matter of law,</i> but would have to present <i>his</i> evidence to a trier of fact.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Fourth, and specifically as to an antitrust action for unlawful conspiracy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*863</span> under provisions including section 1 of the Cartwright Act, which, like its Sherman Act analogue, makes a conspiracy among competitors to restrict output and/or raise prices unlawful per se without regard to any of its effects (see, e.g., <i>Oakland Alameda County Builders' Exchange v. F.P. Lathrop Constr. Co.</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.3d 354</span>, 360-362, <span class=\"citation no-link\">93 Cal.Rptr. 602</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">482 P.2d 226</span>): On the defendants' motion for summary judgment, in order to carry a burden of production to make a prima facie showing that there is a triable issue of the material fact of the existence of an unlawful conspiracy, a plaintiff, who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial, must present evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find in his favor on the unlawful-conspiracy issue by a preponderance of the evidence, that is, to find an unlawful conspiracy more likely than not. Ambiguous evidence or inferences showing or implying conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition by independent actors as with unlawful conspiracy by colluding ones do not allow such a trier of fact so to find.<sup>[17]</sup> Antitrust law, including the Cartwright Act, compels the result. Otherwise, it might effectively chill procompetitive conduct in the world at large, the very thing that it is designed to protect (see <i>Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson</i> (1976) <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.3d 920</span>, 935, <span class=\"citation no-link\">130 Cal.Rptr. 1</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">549 P.2d 833</span>), by subjecting it to undue costs in the judicial sphere. Therefore, in addition, the plaintiff must present evidence that tends to exclude, although it need not actually exclude, the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently rather than collusively. Insufficient is a mere assertion that a reasonable trier of fact might disbelieve any denial by the defendants of an unlawful conspiracy. \"If\" the defendants are \"otherwise entitled to a summary judgment,\" as a general rule \"summary judgment\" may \"not be denied on grounds of credibility or for want of cross-examination....\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (e).) We own that, in <i>Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc.</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.3d 842</span>, 852, <span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal.Rptr. 785</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">484 P.2d 953</span>, we expressed a belief that, in such an action, courts should grant motions for summary judgment by defendants \"sparingly.\" But \"sparingly\" does <i>not</i> mean \"seldom if ever.\" Hence, although such motions should be denied when they should, they must be granted when they must.</p>\n<p>It follows that summary judgment law in this state now conforms, largely but not completely, to its federal counterpart as clarified and liberalized in <i>Celotex, Anderson,</i> and <i>Matsushita.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*864</span> For example, summary judgment law in this state no longer requires a plaintiff moving for summary judgment to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of his own cause of action. In this particular, it now accords with federal law. All that the plaintiff need do is to \"prove[ ] each element of the cause of action.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(1).)<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Neither does summary judgment law in this state any longer require a defendant moving for summary judgment to conclusively negate an element of the plaintiffs cause of action.<sup>[19]</sup> In this particular too, it now accords with federal law. All that the defendant need do is to \"show[ ] that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established\" by the plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) In other words, all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff cannot establish at least one element of the cause of action\u0097for example, that the plaintiff cannot prove element X.<sup>[20]</sup> Although he remains free to do so, the defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element\u0097for example, himself prove <i>not X.</i><sup>[21]</sup> This is in line <span class=\"star-pagination\">*865</span> with the purpose of the 1992 and 1993 amendments, which was to liberalize the granting of motions for summary judgment. As Justice Chin stated in his concurring opinion in <i>Guz,</i> \"[g]iven the difficulty of proving a negative, ... a test\" requiring conclusive negation \"is often impossibly high.\" (<i>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">24 Cal.4th 317</a></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352</span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">8 P.3d 1089</a></span> (cone. opn. of Chin, J.); accord, <i>Saelzler v.

The defendant has shown that the plaintiff cannot establish at least one element of the cause of action by showing that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence: The defendant must show that the plaintiff <i>does not possess</i> needed evidence, because otherwise the plaintiff might be able to establish the elements of the cause of action; the defendant must also show that the plaintiff <i>cannot reasonably obtain</i> needed evidence, because the plaintiff must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to oppose the motion (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (h)).<sup>[22]</sup> We recognize that the legislative history of the 1992 and 1993 amendments contains certain summaries at least arguably supporting the perdurance of the conclusive negation requirement. But it was the 1992 and 1993 amendments \"that [were] enacted, not any\" such summary. (<i>In re Cervera</i> (2001) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631235/in-re-cervera/\">24 Cal.4th 1073</a></span>, 1079, <span class=\"citation no-link\">103 Cal.Rptr.2d 762</span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631235/in-re-cervera/\">16 P.3d 176</a></span>.) It is the former that \"must prevail over\" the latter, and not the opposite. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 1079-1080, <span class=\"citation no-link\">103 Cal.Rptr.2d 762</span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631235/in-re-cervera/\">16 P.3d 176</a></span>.) In his concurring opinion in <i>Guz,</i> Justice Chin anticipated the conclusion that we here reach. (<i>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">24 Cal.4th 317</a></span>, 373-374, <span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352</span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\">8 P.3d 1089</a></span> (cone. opn. of Chin, J.).) We therefore embrace it fully.</p>\n<p>Summary judgment law in this state, however, continues to require a defendant moving for summary judgment to present evidence, and not simply point out<sup>[23]</sup> that the plaintiff does not possess, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*866</span> and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence. In this particular at least, it still diverges from federal law. For the defendant <i>must</i> \"support[ ]\" the \"motion\" with evidence including \"affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice\" must or may \"be taken.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).) The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiffs cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence\u0097as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing.<sup>[24]</sup> But, as <i>Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson</i> (9th Cir.2000) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768709\"><a href=\"/opinion/768709/patricia-ann-fairbankplaintiff-appellant-v-wunderman-cato-johnson-a/\">212 F.3d 528</a></span> concludes, the defendant <i>must</i> indeed present \"evidence\": Whereas, under federal law, `pointing out through argument' (<i>id.</i> at p. 532) may be sufficient (see generally Schwarzer et al, Cal. Practice Guide: Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00b6\u00b6 14:137 to 14:137.6, pp. 14-32 to 14-33 [setting out the `disagree[ment]' of the `[c]ourts' on the issue]), under state law, it is not.</p>\n<p>To speak broadly, all of the foregoing discussion of summary judgment law in this state, like that of its federal counterpart, may be reduced to, and justified by, a single proposition: If a party moving for summary judgment in any action, including an antitrust action for unlawful conspiracy, would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination, then he should prevail on summary judgment. In such a Justice Chin stated in his concurring opinion in <i>Guz,</i> the \"court should grant\" the motion \"and avoid a ... trial\" rendered \"useless\" by nonsuit or directed verdict or similar device.

We agree. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p>Aguilar also claims that the court may not weigh the plaintiffs evidence or inferences against the defendants' as though it were sitting as the trier of fact. We agree here as well. The court may not \"grant[ ]\" the defendants' motion for summary judgment \"based on inferences ..., if contradicted by other inferences or evidence, which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) Neither, apparently, may the court grant their motion based on any evidence from which such inferences are drawn, if so contradicted. That means that, if the court concludes that the plaintiffs evidence or inferences raise a triable issue of material fact, it must conclude its consideration and deny the defendants' motion.</p>\n<p>But, even though the court may not weigh the plaintiffs evidence or inferences against the defendants' as though it were sitting as the trier of fact, it must nevertheless determine what any evidence or inference <i>could show or imply to a reasonable trier of fact.</i> Aguilar effectively admits as much.<sup>[26]</sup> In so doing, it does not decide on any finding of its own, but simply decides what finding such a trier of fact could make for itself. (Cf. <i>Kidron v. Movie Acquisition Corp.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">40 Cal. App.4th 1571</span>, 1580-1581, <span class=\"citation no-link\">47 Cal.Rptr.2d 752</span> [motion for nonsuit]; <i>Salter v.

Rptr. 430</span> [same].)</p>\n<p>Thus, if the court determines that any evidence or inference presented or drawn by the plaintiff indeed shows or implies unlawful conspiracy <i>more likely than</i> permissible competition, it must then deny the defendants' motion for summary judgment, even in the face of contradictory evidence or inference presented or drawn by the defendants, because a reasonable trier of fact could find for the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the unlawful-conspiracy issue is triable\u0097that is, it must be submitted to a trier of fact for determination in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendants, and may not be taken from the trier of fact and resolved by the court itself in the defendants' favor and against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>But if the court determines that all of the evidence presented by the plaintiff, and all of the inferences drawn therefrom, show and imply unlawful conspiracy <i>only as likely as</i> permissible competition <i>or even less likely,</i> it must then grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, even apart from any evidence presented by the defendants or any inferences drawn therefrom, because a reasonable trier of fact could not find for the plaintiff.<sup>[27]</sup> Under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*868</span> such circumstances, the unlawful-conspiracy issue is not triable\u0097that is, it may not be submitted to a trier of fact for determination in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendants, but must be taken from the trier of fact and resolved by the court itself in the defendants' favor and against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that a plaintiff like Aguilar must often rely on inference rather than evidence since, usually, unlawful conspiracy is conceived in secrecy and lives its life in the shadows. (See <i>Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co.</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal.4th 26</span>, 48, <span class=\"citation no-link\">77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">960 P.2d 513</span>; <i>Saxer v. Philip Morris, Inc.</i> (1975) <span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal.App.3d 7</span>, 27, <span class=\"citation no-link\">126 Cal. Rptr. 327</span>.) But, when he does so, he must all the same rely on an inference implying unlawful conspiracy <i>more likely than</i> permissible competition, either in itself or together with other inferences or evidence. Aguilar claims that the inference need only be reasonable. True.<sup>[28]</sup> But, as she herself effectively admits, the inference is reasonable if, and only if, it implies unlawful conspiracy <i>more likely than</i> permissible competition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We have before us the decision of the Court of Appeal reversing the order of the superior court granting a new trial on Aguilar's motion and directing it to grant summary judgment on the petroleum companies' motions.</p>\n<p>Prior to turning to the Court of Appeal's decision itself, we address an issue at the threshold.</p>\n<p>As noted, the Court of Appeal denied Aguilar's motion to dismiss the petroleum companies' appeals.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Court of Appeal was right to do so.</p>\n<p>In support of her motion to dismiss the petroleum companies' appeals, Aguilar claimed, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal had not been presented with any appealable judgment or order over which it could assert jurisdiction. Unpersuasively so.</p>\n<p>Aguilar moved the superior court for a new trial following its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. A motion for a new trial is appropriate following an order granting summary judgment. (<i>Kohan v.

Simmonds</i> (1957) <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.2d 84</span>, 87-91, <span class=\"citation no-link\">315 P.2d 305</span> [holding that a motion for a new trial is appropriate following an order granting judgment on the pleadings].) This is so, even though, strictly speaking, \"summary judgment ... is a determination that there shall be no trial at all.\" (<i>Green v. Del-Camp Investments, Inc., supra,</i> 193 Cal. App.2d at p. 481,<span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Cal.Rptr. 420</span>.)</p>\n<p>On Aguilar's motion, the superior court granted a new trial following its order granting the petroleum companies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*869</span> summary judgment. An order granting a new trial is appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(4).) To be clear, <i>\"any</i> order granting a new trial is appealable.\" (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 146, p. 213, italics added.) There is no exception for an order granting a new trial <i>following an order granting summary judgment.</i> It makes no difference that an order granting a new trial may operate like an order denying summary judgment, which is nonappealable. (<i>Waschek v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra,</i> 59 Cal.App.4th at pp. 643-644, fn. 4, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Cal.Rptr.2d 296</span>; <i>Malo v. Willis, supra,</i> 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 546, fn. 2, <span class=\"citation no-link\">178 Cal.Rptr. 774</span>.) The fact is, it is, and remains, an order granting a new trial, which is appealable.</p>\n<p>Unable to avoid the force of our analysis, Aguilar suggests that, in arguing that the Court of Appeal properly denied her motion to dismiss their appeals, the petroleum companies have relied on law that is lacking in vitality, and have done so in an attempt to \"manufacture appealability\" <i>(</i><i>Malo v. Willis, supra,</i> 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 546, fn. 2, <span class=\"citation no-link\">178 Cal.Rptr. 774</span>). Their law, however, is not lacking in vitality. Neither have they made any attempt to manufacture appealability. Indeed, it is rather Aguilar who has attempted to manufacture <i>non</i> appealability. On the petroleum companies' motions, the superior court caused entry of an appealable (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (<i>l)</i>) summary judgment. On Aguilar's motion, the superior court issued an appealable order granting a new trial. Aguilar would transform the appealable order granting a new trial into a nonappealable order denying summary judgment. She may not do so. And since she may not, she may not complain that the petroleum companies failed to \"petition\" the Court of Appeal \"for a peremptory writ\" against the superior court for its nonexistent nonappealable order denying summary judgment. (<i>Ibid.</i>)<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>Turning to the Court of Appeal's decision, we believe that the Court of Appeal was right to apply the independent standard of review to the superior court's order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p>It is true, as Aguilar argues, that, as a general matter, orders granting a new trial are examined for abuse of discretion. (See, e.g., <i>Schelbauer v. Butler Manufacturing Co.</i> (1984) <span class=\"citation no-link\">35 Cal.3d 442</span>, 452, <span class=\"citation no-link\">198 Cal.Rptr. 155</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">673 P.2d 743</span>; <i>Jiminez v.

(See, e.g., <i>People v. Waidla</i> (2000) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal.4th 690</span>, 730, <span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal.

Rptr.2d 385</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">926 P.2d 365</span>.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*870</span> The sole determination underlying the superior court's order granting a new trial was the asserted erroneousness of its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment. An order granting summary judgment, of course, is reviewed independently. (E.g., <i>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra,</i> 24 Cal.4th at p. 334, <span class=\"citation no-link\">100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">8 P.3d 1089</span>; <i>Norgart v.

(See <i>Parker v. Womack</i> (1951) <span class=\"citation no-link\">37 Cal.2d 116</span>, 123, <span class=\"citation no-link\">230 P.2d 823</span>, overruled on another point by <i>Butigan v.

Rheem</i> (1961) <span class=\"citation no-link\">192 Cal.App.2d 49</span>, 53-54, <span class=\"citation no-link\">13 Cal.Rptr. 496</span>.)</p>\n<p>To be precise: To adopt a reading of decisional law, as the superior court did with regard to <i>Biljac,</i> entails the resolution of a pure question of law, inasmuch as it \"relate[s] to the selection of a rule.\" (<i>Crocker National Bank v. City and County of San Francisco</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.3d 881</span>, 888, <span class=\"citation no-link\">264 Cal.Rptr. 139</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">782 P.2d 278</span>.) And to make an application of decisional law, as the superior court also did with regard to <i>Biljac,</i> entails the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law, inasmuch as it \"requires a critical consideration, in a factual context, of legal principles and their underlying values\" rather than merely \"experience with human affairs.\" (<i>Crocker National Bank v. City and County of San Francisco, supra,</i> 49 Cal.3d at p. 888, <span class=\"citation no-link\">264 Cal.Rptr. 139</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">782 P.2d 278</span>.) The former is scrutinized de novo. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>) So too the latter. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">Ibid.</span></i>) There is no discretion to adopt a reading, or make an application, of decisional law that is inconsistent with the law itself. (See <i>City of Sacramento v. Drew</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">207 Cal.App.3d 1287</span>, 1297-1298, <span class=\"citation no-link\">255 Cal.Rptr. 704</span>.) Any such reading or application must necessarily be deemed an abuse. (See <i><span class=\"citation no-link\">ibid.</span></i>)</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal soundly concluded that the superior court's order granting a new trial was erroneous because the Court of Appeal soundly concluded\u0097in substantial anticipation of our analysis of summary judgment law\u0097that the superior court's underlying order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment was <i>not</i> erroneous.</p>\n<p>In arriving at our determination, we do not ignore the fact that this is, primarily, a complex antitrust action for unlawful conspiracy under section 1 of the Cartwright Act, indeed, a very complex one. We could not do so even if we would, confronting as we do the Court of Appeal's lengthy and detailed opinion. But neither can we ignore the fact that summary judgment is available, and always remains available, even in complex cases. (See <i>First State Ins. Co. v. Superior Court</i> (2000) <span class=\"citation no-link\">79 Cal.App.4th 324</span>, 329-331, <span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal. Rptr.2d 104</span>.)</p>\n<p>To proceed, the superior court's order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment was not erroneous as to Aguilar's primary cause of action, which was for an unlawful conspiracy under section 1 of the Cartwright Act to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price.</p>\n<p>At trial, Aguilar as plaintiff would have borne the burden of proof by a preponderance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*871</span> of the evidence as to her Cartwright Act cause of action. As a general rule, the \"party desiring relief\" bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (<i>Buss v. Superior Court</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239173/buss-v-superior-court/\">16 Cal.4th 35</a></span>, 53-54, <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">939 P.2d 766</span> [so holding under Evid.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 115 &amp; 500, as to the quantum and placement of the burden of proof, respectively].) So it is here. (See <i>Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal.3d 302</span>, 317, <span class=\"citation no-link\">148 Cal.Rptr. 918</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">583 P.2d 777</span>.)</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies carried their burden of persuasion to show that there was no triable issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to Aguilar's Cartwright Act cause of action.</p>\n<p>At the outset, the petroleum companies carried their initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy. Through the declarations by their officers and managers and similar employees\u0097and through material from others including third parties\u0097they presented evidence that would require a reasonable jury <i>not</i> to find any conspiracy more likely than not.<sup>[30]</sup> The declarations in question, it must be emphasized, generally stated on personal knowledge how the companies made their capacity, production, and pricing decisions about CARB gasoline. Hence, they did more than baldly assert that they made them independently, and did more than baldly deny that they made them collusively with each other.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to summarize the petroleum companies' evidence within a scope that would be appropriate to this opinion. The Court of Appeal's recounting itself fills 38 pages. With that said, the petroleum companies' evidence showed independence rather than collusion as to their most fundamental strategies with respect to CARB gasoline. For example, at one end of the range, there was Chevron's altogether active plan, which was to \"gain an advantage over its competitors by becoming the largest producer of CARB gasoline in the world.\" At the other end, there was Union Oil's relatively passive stance, which would put it at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis its competitors in this regard, and would lead it to exit the market completely.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Aguilar did not carry the burden of production shifted onto her shoulders to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful conspiracy. She did not present evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find a conspiracy more likely than not\u0097her \"evidence,\" as the Court of Appeal noted, often being less than it was claimed to be.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the evidence that Aguilar did present was at best ambiguous, as were the inferences that she drew therefrom, showing or implying conduct that was at least as consistent with permissible competition by the petroleum companies as independent actors, as with unlawful conspiracy by them as colluding ones. Evidence of this sort, however, was insufficient. So too were related inferences.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in addition, Aguilar had to present evidence that tended to exclude the possibility that the petroleum companies acted independently rather than collusively. This she did not do.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*872</span> For example, Aguilar's evidence concerning the gathering and dissemination of capacity, production, and pricing information by the petroleum companies, through OPIS or otherwise, with respect to CARB gasoline does not even imply collusive, rather than independent, action. What the United States Supreme Court stated three-quarters of a century ago in <i>Maple Flooring Mfrs. Ass'n v. U.S.</i> (1925) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100698\"><a href=\"/opinion/100698/maple-flooring-assn-v-united-states/\">268 U.S. 563</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100698\"><a href=\"/opinion/100698/maple-flooring-assn-v-united-states/\">45 S.Ct. 578</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 L.Ed. 1093</span>, remains true today: \"It is the consensus of opinion of economists and of many of the most important agencies of Government that the public interest is served by the gathering and dissemination, in the widest possible manner, of information\" of the sort identified above \"because the making available of such information tends to stabilize trade and industry, to produce fairer price levels and to avoid the waste which inevitably attends the unintelligent conduct of economic enterprise. Free competition means a free and open market among both buyers and sellers for the sale and distribution of commodities. Competition does not become less free merely because the conduct of commercial operations becomes more intelligent through the free distribution of knowledge of all the essential factors entering into the commercial transaction.\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 582-583, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100698\"><a href=\"/opinion/100698/maple-flooring-assn-v-united-states/\">45 S.Ct. 578</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 L.Ed. 1093</span>.) To be sure, such information can be misused as a \"basis\" for an unlawful conspiracy. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 585, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100698\"><a href=\"/opinion/100698/maple-flooring-assn-v-united-states/\">45 S.Ct. 578</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 L.Ed. 1093</span>.) The evidence here, however, does not suggest such misuse.</p>\n<p>Neither does Aguilar's evidence going to the use of common consultants by the petroleum companies even imply collusive, rather than independent, action. For decisions of the magnitude and difficulty that the companies each faced with respect to CARB gasoline capacity, production, and pricing, they had available few consultants who possessed the requisite expertise to assure their competence. Hence, practically speaking, they had to utilize the same ones if they were to utilize any. Each company required confidentiality of each consultant. There is no indication that any company got anything less from any consultant. It is true that common consultants can be misused as a \"conduit\" for an unlawful conspiracy. (<i>In re Potash Antitrust Litigation</i> (D.Minn.1997) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488883\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488883/in-re-potash-antitrust-litigation/\">954 F.Supp. 1334</a></span>, 1360 [dismissing any suggestion that certain foreign governmental officials were so misused], affd. <i>sub nom. </i><i>Blomkest Fertilizer, Inc. v.

But, again, the evidence here does not suggest such misuse.</p>\n<p>For its part, Aguilar's evidence relating to the exchange agreements entered into by the petroleum companies, including any consequent activity, or lack of activity, in the spot market, does not even imply collusive, rather than independent, action. Exchange agreements have long been common in the petroleum industry. (See <i>Laketon Asphalt Ref. v. U.S. Dept. of Int.</i> (7th Cir.1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\">624 F.2d 784</span>, 797; <i>Blue Bell Co. v.

More important, exchange agreements have long been recognized as procompetitive in purpose and effect, enabling or facilitating companies to compete in product and/or geographical and/or temporal markets in which they otherwise could not or would not compete as efficiently or at all. (See generally <i>Blue Bell Co. v. Frontier Refining Co., supra,</i> 213 F.2d at p. 359; see also <i>Laketon Asphalt Ref. v.

Frontier Refining Co., supra,</i> 213 F.2d at p. 359 [<i>semble</i>].) But, yet again, the evidence here does not suggest such misuse.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Aguilar's related evidence of the opinion of her experts, which was itself based at least in part on evidence such as that described above, proved to be of no marginal value. Expert opinion may indeed be \"useful as a guide to interpreting market facts....\" (<i>Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\">509 U.S. 209</a></span>, 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\">113 S.Ct. 2578</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\">125 L.Ed.2d 168</a></span>.) But \"it is\" simply \"not a substitute\" therefor. (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\">Ibid.</a></span></i>) In our view, the expert opinion here was more a \"substitute\" than a \"guide.\" In effect, it conjectured that there <i>must have been</i> collusive, rather than independent, action. It did so, at bottom, because it discerned interdependent action. But, in an oligopoly, such as obtains here, interdependence is altogether consistent with independence, and is not necessarily indicative of collusion. \"[I]n a market served by\" a few \"large firms,\" like the market for CARB gasoline served by the petroleum companies, \"each firm must know that if it reduces its price and increases its sales at the expense of its rivals, they will notice the sales loss, identify the cause, and probably respond. In short, each firm is aware of its impact upon the others. Though each may independently decide upon its own course of action, any rational decision must take into account the anticipated reaction of the other[s].... Because of their mutual awareness,\" their \"decisions may be interdependent although arrived at independently.\" (6 Areeda, Antitrust Law, <i>supra,</i> \u00b6 1429a, p. 175.) In such a market, like that here, prices may move generally upward across all of the firms more or less together, rising quickly and falling slowly, and may do so interdependently but nevertheless independently. (See <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 1429b, pp. 175-177.) For collusion, there must be more than interdependence. The expert opinion here, however, does not supply what is lacking.</p>\n<p>We recognize that Aguilar did indeed present evidence that the petroleum companies may have possessed the motive, opportunity, and means to enter into an unlawful conspiracy. But that is all. And that is not enough. Such evidence merely allows speculation about an unlawful conspiracy. Speculation, however, is not evidence. As a result, Aguilar's evidence of the petroleum companies' possible motive, opportunity, and means for entry into an unlawful conspiracy does not amount to evidence showing such a conspiracy more likely than not. Neither does it even support an inference implying as much.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*874</span> The Court of Appeal rejected the superior court's determination that, in granting the petroleum companies summary judgment as to Aguilar's Cartwright Act cause of action, it made an error in law in its reading and application of <i>Biljac.</i> Appropriately so. <i>Biljac</i> held <i>at most</i> that declarations by each person responsible within each of certain entities for certain decisions were <i>sufficient</i> under summary judgment law as it stood prior to the 1992 and 1993 amendments to negate an unlawful conspiracy, presumably conclusively. (<i>Biljac Associates v. First Interstate Bank, supra,</i> 218 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1423-1424, <span class=\"citation no-link\">267 Cal.Rptr. 819</span>.) <i>Biljac</i> did <i>not</i> hold that declarations by officers and managers and similar employees of the sort that the petroleum companies presented here were <i>insufficient</i> under summary judgment law as it stands now even to carry their initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy.<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p>To the extent that the superior court may have erred as to Aguilar's Cartwright Act cause of action, Aguilar cannot raise any complaint, for any such error could have benefited her alone. The superior court appears to have concluded that, in order to carry their initial burden of production, the petroleum companies had to present evidence that conclusively negated an unlawful conspiracy.<sup>[34]</sup> Such a conclusion, however, would be contrary to our analysis. The superior court also appears to have concluded that, in order to carry the burden of production shifted onto her shoulders, Aguilar did <i>not</i> have to present evidence that tended to exclude the possibility that the petroleum companies acted independently rather than collusively, but could present no more than ambiguous evidence or inferences showing or implying conduct that was as consistent with permissible competition by independent sectors as with unlawful conspiracy by colluding ones. Such a conclusion, however, would also be contrary to our analysis.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*875</span> Just as the superior court's order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment was not erroneous as to Aguilar's primary cause of action for an unlawful conspiracy under section 1 of the Cartwright Act to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price, neither was it erroneous as to her derivative cause of action, which was for an unlawful conspiracy under the unfair competition law for the same purpose.</p>\n<p>At trial, Aguilar as plaintiff would have borne the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as to her unfair competition law cause of action. Again, as a general rule, the party desiring relief bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. So it is here.</p>\n<p>The petroleum companies carried their burden of persuasion to show that there was no triable issue of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to Aguilar's unfair competition law cause of action. They did so by doing so as to her Cartwright Act cause of action. Again, they carried their burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy, but she did not carry her shifted burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the presence of an unlawful one.</p>\n<p>It is true, as Aguilar argues, that her unfair competition law cause of action is not based on allegations asserting a conspiracy <i>unlawful under the Cartwright Act.</i> But it is indeed based on allegations asserting a <i>conspiracy,</i> specifically, one unlawful at least under the unfair competition law itself. As stated, the petroleum companies showed that there was no triable issue of the material fact of conspiracy. Aguilar claims that conspiracy is not an element of an unfair competition law cause of action in the abstract as a matter of law. Correctly so. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) But she simply cannot deny that conspiracy is indeed a component of the unfair competition law cause of action <i>in this case as a matter of fact.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we conclude that we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>WE CONCUR: GEORGE, C.J., KENNARD, J., CHIN, J., BROWN, J., HOLLENHORST, J.,<sup>[*]</sup> and KITCHING, J.<sup>[**]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  During pendency of a subsequent appeal, Union Oil Company of California entered into a judicially approved settlement with Aguilar, was dismissed from the action with prejudice, was consequently dismissed from the appeal, and, hence, does not make an appearance on review. Even though it did not participate much on appeal and did not participate at all on review, it did indeed participate generally in the events recounted herein, both within court and without. The collective phrase \"petroleum companies,\" which we use throughout for the sake of convenience, should be understood accordingly.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court of Appeal implied that, in support of its motion for summary judgment, Tosco alone of the petroleum companies did not present, or at least did not rely on, any declaration by any of its officers or managers or similar employees. But, in fact, like all of the others, it did indeed do so.</p>\n<p>[3]  Ultramar requests us to take judicial notice of Attorney General of the State of California, Report on Gasoline Pricing in California (May 2000). Aguilar opposes. We nevertheless grant the request. As a \"reviewing court\" (Evid.Code, \u00a7 459, subd. (a)), we may take judicial notice of the report of a state executive officer as reflecting an \"[o]fficial act[ ]\" (<i>id.,</i> \u00a7 452, subd. (c); see Assem. Com. on Judiciary com., reprinted at 29B pt. 1 West's Ann.Evid.Code (1995 ed.) foll. \u00a7 452, p. 450). We hereby do so as to the Attorney General's report. Aguilar claims that Ultramar's request amounts to an attempt improperly to augment the record. We would not allow any such attempt to succeed. We consider the Attorney General's report only for background. To the extent that Aguilar moves us to strike, as an improper augmentation of the record, a volume of appendices including the Attorney General's report that Tosco has submitted with its brief in this court, we deny her application, considering the materials therein only for background.</p>\n<p>[4]  On summary judgment, the moving party's burden is more properly labeled as one of <i>persuasion</i> rather than <i>proof.</i> That is because, in order to carry such burden, he must <i>persuade</i> the court that there is no material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find, and not <i>prove</i> any such fact to the satisfaction of the court itself as though it were sitting as the trier of fact. (See <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra</i><i>, All</i> U.S. at p. 249, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\">106 S.Ct. 2505</a></span>.)</p>\n<p>[5]  All that is stated in the text is true under <i>Matsushita</i> for <i>any</i> antitrust claim asserting an unlawful conspiracy under section 1 of the Sherman Act by <i>any</i> plaintiff. But where the \"factual context\" of a particular claim shows it to be \"implausible\" as \"simply mak[ing] no economic sense,\" then the particular plaintiff \"must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support [the] claim than would otherwise be necessary.\" (<i>Matsushita Elec.

See, <i>ante,</i> 107 Cal.Rptr.2d at page 858, footnote 5, 24 P.3d at page 508, footnote 5. That is because, as even the petroleum companies themselves admit, Aguilar's claim, whatever its merits, is far from implausible.</p>\n<p>[26]  Accord, 2 Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, <i>supra,</i> paragraph 322, page 71 (stating that \"[a]ssessing the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether a reasonable juror could find that the plaintiff has satisfied his burden of persuasion is a traditional judicial function\").</p>\n<p>[27]  Accord, 2 Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, <i>supra,</i> paragraph 322, page 70 (stating that, \"when the evidence is in equipoise on a matter that a party must establish by a preponderance of the evidence, summary judgment will be granted against that party\"); 6 Areeda, Antitrust Law, <i>supra,</i> paragraph 1423d, page 139 (implying that, when a reasonable trier of fact \"cannot say whether\" a \"conspiratorial or non-conspiratorial explanation is more probable,\" \"summary judgment ... would have to be given against the party bearing the burden of persuasion\" by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p>[28]  Compare <i>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112744\"><a href=\"/opinion/112744/eastman-kodak-co-v-image-technical-services-inc/\">504 U.S. 451</a></span>, 468, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112744\"><a href=\"/opinion/112744/eastman-kodak-co-v-image-technical-services-inc/\">112 S.Ct. 2072</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112744\"><a href=\"/opinion/112744/eastman-kodak-co-v-image-technical-services-inc/\">119 L.Ed.2d 265</a></span> (stating that <i>\"Matsushita</i> demands only that the . . . inferences\" of the party opposing a motion for summary judgment \"be reasonable in order to reach\" a trier of fact).</p>\n<p>[29]  In successfully moving the superior court for a new trial following its order granting the petroleum companies summary judgment, Aguilar, in effect, sought and obtained reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment. It is not hard to infer why she did not move for reconsideration <i>eo nomine.</i> First, to make a motion for reconsideration, she would have had to have \"new or different facts, circumstances, or law\" in support. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1008, subd. (a).) She apparently had none. Second, by the date on which she made her motion for a new trial, the superior court had caused entry of judgment. After entry of judgment, the superior court did not have jurisdiction to entertain or decide a motion for reconsideration. (See, e.g., <i>In re Marriage of Condon</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\">62 Cal. App.4th 533</span>, 541, fn. 8, <span class=\"citation no-link\">73 Cal.Rptr.2d 33</span>; <i>Betz v. Pankow</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.App.4th 931</span>, 937-938, <span class=\"citation no-link\">20 Cal.Rptr.2d 841</span>.) Hence, she could not have made a motion for reconsideration in the first place.</p>\n<p>[30]  Like the Court of Appeal, Aguilar implies that, in support of its motion for summary judgment, Tosco alone of the petroleum companies did not present, or at least did not rely on, any declaration by any of its officers or managers or similar employees. That is not the case. See, <i>ante,</i> 107 Cal.Rptr.2d at page 854, footnote 2, 24 P.3d at page 504, footnote 2.</p>\n<p>[31]  Exchange agreements have also be recognized as \"pro-environmental\" and safety enhancing, as by the Court of Appeal, to the extent that they obviate or reduce the ecological and other risks attendant on the storage and transportation of petroleum products.</p>\n<p>[32]  See, e.g., <i>Serfecz v. Jewel Food Stores</i> (7th Cir.1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705929\"><a href=\"/opinion/705929/joseph-serfecz-and-first-chicago-trust-v-jewel-food-stores/\">67 F.3d 591</a></span>, 600-601 (holding that, \"by itself,\" evidence of motive to enter into an unlawful conspiracy \"does not tend to exclude the possibility of independent, legitimate action and supplies no basis for inferring [such] a conspiracy\"); <i>Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher &amp; Co.</i> (3d Cir.1994) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679976\"><a href=\"/opinion/679976/alvord-polk-inc-american-blind-factory-inc-delta-paint-and-wallpaper/\">37 F.3d 996</a></span>, 1013 (holding to similar effect expressly as to evidence of opportunity and impliedly as to evidence of means).</p>\n<p>[33]  In the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeal characterized the superior court's determination that it made an error in law in its reading and application of <i>Biljac</i> as \"in fact\" a \"reflect[ion]\" of \"its belief that its initial decision regarding the evidentiary strength of\" the declarations by officers and managers and similar employees presented by the petroleum companies \"was incorrect.\" We agree with the Court of Appeal about the superior court's belief. But we think it plain that the superior court formed its belief because it determined that it made an error in law in its reading and application of <i>Biljac.</i></p>\n<p>[34]  Although it did not criticize the superior court on this score, the Court of Appeal all but expressly concluded that evidence that conclusively negated an unlawful conspiracy was of course sufficient, but not necessary, to carry an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy.</p>\n<p>[35]  In alleging facts for her Cartwright Act cause of action, Aguilar proceeded on a theory, which was legally sound (see <i>Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc., supra, 22</i> Cal.3d at p. 314, <span class=\"citation no-link\">148 Cal.Rptr. 918</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">583 P.2d 777</span>), that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of an agreement among the petroleum companies as competitors to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price, and was unlawful per se without regard to any of its effects. In granting the petroleum companies summary judgment, the superior court did so on that theory. On appeal, Aguilar apparently attempted to introduce an alternative theory, which was also legally sound (see <i>ibid.),</i> that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of the various exchange agreements entered into by the various petroleum companies, and was unlawful because of its effects. The Court of Appeal rejected any such attempt as too late. To the extent that Aguilar makes the same attempt on review, we reject it for the same reason. (See <i>Redwood Turkey Hatchery v. Meadowbrook Farms</i> (1957) <span class=\"citation no-link\">152 Cal.App.2d 481</span>, 486, <span class=\"citation no-link\">313 P.2d 146</span> [stating that \"[i]t is the duty of litigants to diligently prepare cases for trial and ordinarily they will not be allowed to gamble on the result of a trial by presenting one theory and then if judgment go against them get a new trial in order to try again for a favorable result under a different theory\"].)</p>\n<p>[*]   Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Two, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p>[**]   Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Three, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n\n</div>",

Defendant stopped paying rent and vacated the premises, claiming fumes from an adjoining dry cleaning business made its office unusable. Plaintiffs filed a complaint for rent owing on the remainder of the lease. When the court ruled the terms of the lease precluded defendant from asserting a defense based on a constructive eviction theory, the parties entered into a stipulated agreement, allowing judgment to be entered in favor of plaintiffs and permitting defendant to appeal the court's ruling on the constructive eviction defense.</p>\n<p>Judgment was entered accordingly on August 10, 1992, and defendant now appeals, asserting: (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to enter this judgment because the case had been dismissed one month earlier, on July 9, 1992; and (2) the court erred in ruling the terms of the parties' lease <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> precluded a defense based on constructive eviction. Because neither contention has merit, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In December 1983, plaintiffs entered into a five-year lease with Walker and Lee Real Estate (Walker) for office space in plaintiffs' shopping center. In 1987, Walker assigned the lease to defendant, who opened an escrow office in the center. In 1989, the lease was extended for an additional five-year period.</p>\n<p>In June 1990, while this lease was in effect, defendant stopped paying rent, vacated the premises and moved its offices to another location. Plaintiffs filed a complaint for rent, asserting defendant was liable for more than $120,000 in damages and rent for the remainder of the lease period. In its answer, defendant asserted the defense of constructive eviction, claiming \"plaintiffs permitted the tenants of adjoining premises [a dry cleaning business] to operate a business on such adjoining premises in such a manner as to permit dangerous and noxious chemical odors to penetrate into the premises leased by defendant..., thereby endangering the health of [its] employees[.]\"</p>\n<p>Defendant also filed a cross-complaint for constructive eviction, alleging plaintiffs failed to rectify the problems created by fumes from the adjoining dry cleaners, forcing it to vacate the premises. Defendant sought to recover for lost business income, moving expenses, employee medical expenses, and punitive damages. Defendant apparently settled this matter with plaintiffs' insurer, and the cross-complaint was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p>Before trial, plaintiffs moved to exclude any evidence relating to a constructive eviction theory. They asserted paragraph 24 of the parties' lease precluded such a defense. That lease section, entitled \"Default by Landlord,\" provided: \"Landlord shall not be in default unless Landlord fails to perform obligations required of Landlord within a reasonable time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after written notice by Tenant to Landlord; ... provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord's obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance then Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion. <i>In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate this Lease as a result of</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> <i>Landlord's default and Tenant's remedies shall be limited to damages and/or an injunction.</i>\"<sup>[1]</sup> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>The trial court concluded this paragraph precluded defendant from raising a defense of constructive eviction to plaintiffs' complaint for rent. As expressed by the trial judge, \"defendant vacated the premises on June 15, 1990, did not pay rent, set up shop elsewhere, and refused to comply with any term further to comply with any terms of the lease. [\u00b6] That is a termination of the lease. I refer to Civil Code section 1951.2. [\u00b6] Further, whether the alleged constructive eviction is labeled a defense or a remedy is unimportant, because termination of the lease is not permitted. That right was contracted away by the defendant by paragraph 24 of the lease.\" (Capitalization omitted.) Recognizing this ruling effectively nullified the only defense it had to plaintiffs' claim, defendant entered into a stipulated agreement with plaintiffs on the same day, April 21, 1992. Pursuant to this agreement, judgment was to be entered in favor of plaintiffs for $138,101.61 plus costs and attorney fees according to a cost bill to be filed by plaintiffs. Defendant preserved its right to appeal the court's ruling on the constructive eviction issue, but not the principal amount of the judgment. The parties agreed judgment would be entered after the approval of the cost bill, and defendant would appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p>Despite the understanding of the parties, the clerk of the court sent a \"Notice to File Dismissal and/or Order to Show Cause\" to the parties on May 18, 1992. This notice stated: \"The Court, having been advised of the settlement of this matter, directs the plaintiff ... to file a dismissal ... within forty-five (45) days of the date of this notice. [\u00b6] <i>If a Dismissal ... is not filed within the time set forth above, ALL COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE HEREBY ORDERED to show cause before this Court on 07/09/92 at 08:30am, ... why the action should not be dismissed pursuant to Rule 225, California Rules of Court.</i> ... Failure to comply with this notice may result in the imposition of monetary sanctions and/or dismissal of the case.\" (Italics in original.)<sup>[2]</sup> (This notice is hereafter referred to as the rule 225 notice.)</p>\n<p>The clerk of the court mailed this rule 225 notice to the parties, but sent the notice to plaintiffs at an incorrect address. Plaintiffs apparently never received the notice.</p>\n<p>One week later, on May 26, plaintiffs submitted a memorandum of costs, including attorney fees. Defendant's motion to tax costs was denied, and on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> August 3, plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment to the court. This judgment, filed August 10, 1992, awarded plaintiffs a total of $210,952.47.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>However, one month earlier, on July 9, 1992, the court held a hearing on the rule 225 notice it had previously sent to plaintiffs. Because plaintiffs had not received the notice, they were not present at the hearing. For unknown reasons, defendant was also absent. The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint pursuant to rule 225 of the California Rules of Court. Copies of the minute order and judgment of dismissal were mailed to plaintiffs, again at the wrong address.</p>\n<p>Notice was, however, properly mailed to defendant. Despite the dismissal, defendant chose to challenge the August 10 judgment by filing a motion for new trial. The court denied the motion, ruling the stipulated judgment had not reserved the right to make such a motion. Defendant then filed this appeal from the August 10 judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Effect of July 9 Dismissal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(1a) In a claim raised for the first time on appeal, defendant asserts the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment on August 10 because the case had previously been dismissed on July 9. Plaintiffs counter that the July 9 dismissal is void, because there was no proper service of either the rule 225 notice or the ensuing judgment of dismissal.<sup>[4]</sup> We conclude plaintiffs have the better argument.</p>\n<p>(2) Code of Civil Procedure section 1012 authorizes service by mail. (All subsequent statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.) In setting forth the requirements for such service, section 1013, subdivision (a), provides that the notice must be mailed \"in a sealed envelope, with postage paid, addressed to the person on whom it is to be served, <i>at the office address as last given by that person on any document filed in the cause</i> and served on the party making service by mail; ...\" (Italics added.) This subdivision applies to mailings by the court clerk.

Thereafter, the clerk of the court sent notices to plaintiffs at their new address. The trial briefs and motions <i>in limine,</i> filed by plaintiffs in April 1992, all bore a caption indicating the address of \"701 University.\" These were the last documents filed by plaintiffs before the clerk mailed the rule 225 notice.</p>\n<p>For unexplained reasons, on May 18, 1992, the clerk of the court sent the rule 225 notice to plaintiffs at their attorneys' old address, 601 University Avenue, an address that had been vacated some 16 months earlier. Plaintiffs apparently did not receive this notice. Subsequent filings by plaintiffs in May and July 1992, relating to costs for the stipulated agreement, all indicated the 701 University address. On July 9, 1992, the court nonetheless mailed its order and judgment of dismissal to plaintiffs at the old address. This last mailing was returned to the court with the notation \"`... Undeliverable as Addressed - Forwarding Order Expired.'\"</p>\n<p>Defendant asserts the dismissal was effective even though it was mailed to the wrong address because under postal regulations, the rule 225 notice must have been forwarded to plaintiffs' new mailing address. Defendant asks that we take judicial notice of these regulations. Plaintiffs do not object to this request, but ask that we take judicial notice of additional postal regulations. We grant both requests.</p>\n<p>Postal regulation No. F020.1.1 provides that \"[r]ecords of permanent change-of-address orders are kept by post offices for 18 months, for forwarding and for address-correction purposes, from the end of the month when the change takes effect.\" Defendant asserts this regulation means that plaintiffs' mail would have been forwarded to them from January 1991, when the change of address was filed, through June 1992, and thus the May 1992 mailing must have been sent on to plaintiffs, because the court file does not indicate it was returned to the sender.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend the rule 225 notice could not be forwarded under postal regulations. They cite postal regulation No. 391, which provides: \"All <span class=\"star-pagination\">*510</span> First-Class Mail, including Priority Mail, and postal cards and postcards, <i>is forwarded at no charge for a period of 1 year</i> when the new address is known. <i>During months 13 through 18, pieces are returned to the sender with an on-piece address correction at no charge.</i>\" (Italics added.) Thus, plaintiffs argue, any notice sent to their old address in May 1992 would have been returned to superior court with a notation indicating the proper address.</p>\n<p>We agree with plaintiffs. The regulations do not support defendant's claim that the rule 225 notice, under the postal regulations, would have been forwarded to plaintiffs. At the time of the mailing and under the governing postal regulations, the notice would not have been forwarded to plaintiffs' new address. Accordingly, it was incumbent upon defendant to establish that the requisite notice had been sent to the correct address. Since the notice was not sent to the \"office address as last given by that person on any document filed in the cause,\" as required by section 1013, subdivision (a), the notice was not effective. The dismissal subsequently entered was therefore void.</p>\n<p>Defendant seeks to avoid this result by offering two alternative theories. First, it claims no notice was required because a dismissal pursuant to rule 225 is self-executing, i.e., a court <i>must</i> dismiss a case 45 days after receiving notice of settlement. Defendant errs. Due process requires notice before a dismissal of a case may be entered.

(3) As one court noted, parties must distinguish \"the authority of a court to dismiss a case because of the actions (or inactions) of its litigants [from] the procedural requirements that precede any such dismissal. At a minimum, such requirements include notice to the plaintiff of a motion or intent to dismiss and an opportunity for plaintiff to be heard.\" (<i>Reid</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Balter,</span> supra</span>,</i> 14 Cal. App.4th at p. 1193.)</p>\n<p>(1c) This notice requirement is implicitly incorporated in rule 225, which authorizes a court to dismiss a case after receiving notice of settlement \"<i>unless</i> good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed.\" (Italics added.) A party must be given notice and an opportunity to make such a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p>Defendant also suggests that plaintiffs could have made a timely notice to vacate the judgment of dismissal because defendant's motion for new trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*511</span> gave plaintiffs notice that such a judgment had been entered. Defendant notes the first sentence of the points and authorities submitted in support of its motion for new trial explicitly stated: \"A Judgment of Dismissal was entered on July 9, 1992.\"</p>\n<p>There are two problems with defendant's argument. First, we question whether this sentence constitutes notice, particularly as the very next sentence states: \"The Judgment was based upon the stipulation of the parties, made in open court on April 22, 1992.\" The only reasonable assumption one could make from these two sentences is that defendant meant to refer to the judgment entered in August 1992. If a judgment of dismissal had been entered, why would defendant be filing a motion for new trial?</p>\n<p>Second, and more importantly, the \"notice\" by defendant does not substitute for compliance with section 1013, subdivision (a). As noted previously, strict compliance with statutory provisions for service by mail is required, and improper service will be given no effect. (<i>Sharp</i> v. <i>Union Pacific R.R. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2134684\"><a href=\"/opinion/2134684/triumph-precision-products-v-ins-co-of-n-am/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 8 Cal.

App.2d at p. 174.) For example, in <i>Triumph Precision Products, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> supra</span>,</i> time for filing a notice of appeal did not begin to run when the notice of an order for new trial was sent to the proper address but without the name of the law firm, resulting in nondelivery. (91 Cal. App.3d at pp. 364-365.) The court held: \"Where the envelope containing the notice is improperly addressed, it is as though notice were never mailed by the clerk.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 365.)</p>\n<p>Here, the clerk failed to comply with section 1013, subdivision (a), in sending the rule 225 notice to plaintiffs. Consequently, the notice was of no effect. Defendant's claim to the contrary is meritless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Defense of Constructive Eviction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(4) Defendant asserts the court erred in concluding the terms of the lease precluded defendant from asserting a defense of constructive eviction for plaintiffs' breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.<sup>[5]</sup> We disagree.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 33(viii) of the lease provided: \"Quiet Possession. Upon Tenant paying the rent reserved hereunder and observing and performing all of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*512</span> covenant conditions and provisions on Tenant's part to be observed and performed hereunder, Tenant shall have quiet possession of the Premises for the entire term hereof, subject to all the provisions of this Lease.\"</p>\n<p>As one court explained: \"Initially, the covenant [of quiet enjoyment] related solely to the right of possession and only protected the lessee against any act of molestation committed by the landlord or anyone claiming under him, or by someone with paramount title, which directly affected the tenant's use and possession of the leased premises; the covenant was construed to protect the lessee against physical interference only. [Citation.] In recent years, the covenant of quiet enjoyment has been expanded, and in this state, for example, it insulates the tenant against any act or omission on the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which interferes with a tenant's right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.\" (<i>Petroleum Collections Inc.</i> v. <i>Swords</i> (1975) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span>, 846 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180734\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180734/petroleum-collections-inc-v-swords/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>Here, the parties' lease explicitly gave defendant the right to quiet enjoyment of the premises. Defendant claims this covenant was breached by the plaintiffs' failure to remedy the ventilation problems caused by the adjoining dry cleaning business. It asserts this breach amounted to a constructive eviction, entitling him to vacate the premises and cease paying rent. Defendant is mistaken.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 33(viii) states defendant \"shall have quiet possession of the Premises for the entire term [of the lease], <i>subject to all the provisions of this Lease.</i>\" (Italics added.) Paragraph 24 of the lease, entitled \"Default by Landlord,\" specifically provides: \"<i>In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate this Lease as a result of Landlord's default and Tenant's remedies shall be limited to damages and/or an injunction.</i>\" (Italics added) The parties thus contracted to limit defendant's remedies in the event of a breach of the lease by plaintiffs: defendant's only remedies were to be damages and/or injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The covenant of quiet enjoyment is codified in California. \"An agreement to let upon hire binds the letter to secure to the hirer the quiet possession of the thing hired during the term of the hiring....\" (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1927.) Under this section, there is an implied covenant on the part of a landlord that a tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises during the continuation of the term.

[is] a part, is embraced within the 15 titles designated in said section 3268 of the Civil Code.\" (<i>Kushner</i> v. <i>Home Service Co.</i> (1928) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span>]: \"A number of decisions describe a rule declaring that a nonphysical interference with the tenant's enjoyment constitutes a constructive eviction; that the tenant may not recover for the eviction unless he first vacates the premises. [Citations.] Another version of the rule is that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is not breached until there has been an actual or constructive eviction. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Stated in these flat terms, the rule would preclude a tenant from seeking damages for a breach of quiet enjoyment not amounting to an eviction. Stated in these terms, the rule is incomplete, for it fails to recognize the tenant's choice of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> remedies for breach of the lease, namely, his option to stand upon the lease and sue for damages.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The lease limited defendant's remedies to damages or injunctive relief in the event of a breach of the covenant of quiet possession. The court properly ruled defendant was precluded from vacating the premises and asserting a constructive eviction defense.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISPOSITION</h2>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Puglia, P.J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>Appellant's petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 17, 1994. Mosk, J., and Kennard, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Plaintiff also asserted the dismissal of defendant's cross-complaint for constructive eviction constituted a retraxit, precluding defendant from raising that defense here.</p>\n<p>[2]  California Rules of Court, rule 225(b), provides: \"[P]laintiff shall file a request for dismissal within 45 days after the date of settlement. If plaintiff does not file the request for dismissal, the court shall dismiss the case 45 days after it receives notice of settlement unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This judgment reflected the agreed-upon amount of $138,101.61 in damages, attorney fees of $69,195 and costs of $3,655.86. The judgment also awarded plaintiffs postjudgment interest at 10 percent from April 21, 1992, the date of the stipulated agreement.</p>\n<p>[4]  Plaintiffs offer a variety of alternative arguments attacking the validity of the dismissal. In addition to asserting the service of the rule 225 notice was improper, they challenge the timeliness of defendant's claim and argue the court lacked the power to dismiss the case given the parties' stipulated agreement. Because we conclude service of the rule 225 notice was ineffective, we have no need to resolve these other issues.</p>\n<p>[5]  As the Restatement Second of Property notes, \"[t]he line between the landlord's interference with his tenant's access to the property for any permissible use, ... and his failure to maintain the leased property in tenantable condition, ... is blurred.\" (Rest.2d Property, \u00a7 6.1, reporter's notes, note 2, p. 231.) Because defendant places its claim on the covenant of quiet enjoyment side of the line, we have no occasion to map the contours of this blurry line.</p>\n<p>[6]  Civil Code section 1953, subdivision (a), provides that lease agreements whereby the tenant agrees to modify or waive certain specified rights are \"void as contrary to public policy.\" This section, however, applies only to leases of \"a dwelling\" and hence has no application to this commercial lease.</p>\n<p>[7]  As noted by the Restatement Second of Property, \"[t]he parties to a lease may agree to increase or decrease what would otherwise be the obligations of the landlord with respect to the condition of the leased property and may agree to expand or contract what would otherwise be the remedies available to the tenant for the breach of those obligations, and those agreements are valid and binding on the parties to the lease unless they are unenforceable in whole or in part because they are unconscionable or significantly against public policy.\" (Rest.2d Property, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 5.6, p. 215.) No claim is made here that the provisions of the lease in this case limiting the remedies available to the tenant for the breach of the landlords' covenant of quiet enjoyment are unconscionable or against public policy.</p>\n<p>[8]  Defendant's reliance upon <i>Leider</i> v. <i>80 William St. Co.</i> (1964) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></span>], is misplaced. The <i>Leider</i> court refused to uphold a similar lease provision dealing with the landlord's default because a tenant could never claim a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as no act of the landlord would ever amount to an eviction. Whatever the rule may be in New York, it is clear in California that a tenant may waive its rights for breach of the covenant of quiet.</p>\n<p>[9]  We therefore have no occasion to resolve plaintiffs' claim that the previous dismissal of defendant's cross-complaint acted as a retraxit, barring a defense based on constructive eviction.</p>\n\n</div>",

Martin, M. Reed Hunter and Anna S. Masters, Los Angeles, for Defendants and Respondents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>WALLIN, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p>Stein-Brief Group, Inc., the developer of two residential projects in south Orange County, sought a declaration that each of its various insurers wrongfully denied coverage and defense of several lawsuits brought against Stein-Brief by lot owners. Following motions in limine, during which Stein-Brief presented its \"best case\" factual scenario, the trial court ruled none of the insurers had any potential for coverage and consequently no duty to defend the underlying lawsuits. Stein-Brief appeals, contending the facts presented establish the insurers owed it a duty to defend in the actions identified below as the Koziol lawsuit and the Dickson lawsuit. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Koziol Lawsuit</i></h2>\n<p>In April 1985, Donald and Lou Smallwood purchased lot 4 located in Monarch Beach <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Villas, a Stein-Brief residential development. At that time, lots 5 and 6 were the parking lot for the model homes and sales office of the Villas. Stein-Brief established an easement on lot 5 for the benefit of adjacent lot 4, and an easement on lot 5 for the benefit of adjacent lot 6. In 1987 lots 5 and 6 were purchased by Stuart Koziol, and a dispute arose between him and the Smallwoods over which house plan could be built on lot 5, the existence of the easement on lot 5 in favor of lot 4, and the placement of the property line wall between lots 4 and 5. This dispute was resolved in 1989 by a written settlement agreement between and among the Smallwoods, Stein-Brief and Koziol (the Smallwood settlement).</p>\n<p>The Smallwood settlement provided, as relevant here, that Koziol could construct only a particular one-story house (the Andalusia plan) on lot 5 and a particular two-story house (the Soto Grande plan) on lot 6; Koziol agreed to accept payment from Stein-Brief in exchange for the disputed easement on lot 5 in favor of lot 4. Stein-Brief agreed to provide Koziol with construction plans for lots 5 and 6, which \"shall have been approved by the County of Orange or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction thereof, and the Villas Homeowners Association, with all fees having been paid by [Stein-Brief].\"</p>\n<p>Koziol thought lot 5 was an \"aesthetically better lot,\" but because it was limited to a one-story structure, he sold it to Terence and Cynthia Whitworth and decided to build a home for himself on lot 6. After the Whitworth escrow closed in June 1989, Koziol discovered Whitworth's building plans for lot 5 provided for an easement across lot 6. Although Koziol had notice of the easement when he purchased the two lots, he believed his ownership of both lots had \"expunged\" it. Furthermore, the site plan attached to the Smallwood settlement did not show an easement on lot 6 in favor of lot 5; it showed placement of the house on lot 6 directly on the easement area. Koziol objected to the Whitworths' building plans, and a heated dispute arose between them.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In the meantime, Stein-Brief hired an architect who prepared building plans for lot 6 and submitted them to the County of Orange for approval; the county returned the plans to the architect for some changes before a construction permit would issue. The architect, convinced that the plans would result in an encroachment on the claimed easement in favor of lot 5, refused to resubmit the plans to the county or to return them to Koziol until March 1990.</p>\n<p>In June 1990, Koziol filed a complaint against Stein-Brief for breach of the Smallwood settlement, which he later dismissed without prejudice so the parties could arbitrate their disagreements. Before arbitration took place, however, Koziol and Stein-Brief engaged in settlement negotiations which Stein-Brief claimed resulted in an enforceable agreement. Koziol refused to honor the agreement, and Stein-Brief filed an action against him to enforce it. In March 1991, Koziol filed a cross-complaint against Stein-Brief based on the Smallwood settlement. He asserted breach of contract, bad faith denial of the existence of the contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The cross-complaint alleged Stein-Brief failed and refused to provide Koziol with plans for construction on lot 6; in reliance on Stein-Briefs representations that Koziol could not build anything other than the Andalusia model on lot 5, he sold lot 5 together with an easement over lot 6; Stein-Brief did not intend to enforce that restriction against the Whitworths; and Koziol had suffered humiliation, mental anguish, nervousness and insomnia as a result of the failure to provide the plans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Dickson Lawsuit</i></h2>\n<p>In 1988, M. Chris Dickson bought a lot in Ritz Cove, another Stein-Brief residential development. During construction of her home, she discovered there was an excessive amount of underground water on the lot. She eventually learned the cause was a defective drainage system. Dickson filed a complaint against Stein-Brief, alleging it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> breached its contract and warranty to her that the lot would be suitable for the construction of a single family residence; it intentionally or negligently induced her to buy the lot by representing there would be no problems with excessive groundwater; it negligently improved the lot; and the excessive groundwater caused her to suffer increased construction costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Insurers</i></h2>\n<p>The Home Insurance Company was Stein-Briefs primary insurer from January 1, 1988 to March 1, 1990; Scottsdale Insurance Company was its primary insurer from March 1, 1990 to March 1, 1991. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania underwrote its umbrella policy. All the policies were commercial general liability policies [CGL], providing, with substantially similar language, coverage for liability because of property damage (loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed) or bodily injury (bodily injury, sickness or disease, including mental anguish and mental injury) arising out of an occurrence (an accident or event resulting in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured). The Home and Scottsdale also underwrote liability coverage for personal injury arising out of wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The declaratory relief action</i></h2>\n<p>Stein-Brief tendered both the Dickson and Koziol lawsuits to the insurers; all refused to defend. In August 1992, Stein-Brief filed a declaratory relief action. At the evaluation conference, the trial court ordered Stein-Brief to file a pretrial motion in limine setting forth its \"best case scenario\" in favor of coverage. The parties subsequently stipulated to a briefing schedule that effectively set up the insurers' responses as cross-motions in limine in favor of no possibility of coverage. The trial court heard argument and found no potential for coverage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Standard of review</i></h2>\n<p>Although couched as cross-motions in limine, the unusual and unorthodox procedure employed by the trial court here does not fit that procedural definition. A motion in limine is prophylactic in nature, made to exclude evidence before it is offered, \"to avoid the obviously futile attempt to `unring the bell' in the event a motion to strike is granted in the proceedings before the jury.\" (<i>Hyatt v. Sierra Boat Co.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">79 Cal. App.3d 325</span>, 337, <span class=\"citation no-link\">145 Cal.Rptr. 47</span>.) Here, the trial court ordered Stein-Brief to set forth the facts most favorable to its case, which the court would assume as true, and then entertained legal arguments from both sides on the question of coverage. This is more in the nature of a motion for nonsuit, or demurrer to the evidence.</p>\n<p>A motion for nonsuit may be made after the plaintiff completes the presentation of his or her evidence or after the opening statement. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 581c, subd. (a).) If the evidence to be presented would not support a verdict in plaintiffs favor, judgment for the defendant may be entered. (<i>John Norton Farms, Inc. v. Todagco</i> (1981) <span class=\"citation no-link\">124 Cal.App.3d 149</span>, 160, <span class=\"citation no-link\">177 Cal.Rptr. 215</span> and cases cited therein.) \"[A] motion for nonsuit `is the modern equivalent of a <i>demurrer to the evidence:</i> it concedes the truth of the facts proved, but denies that they, as a matter of law, sustain the plaintiffs case [Citations.]' [Citations omitted.]\" (<i>Gray v. Kircher</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">193 Cal.App.3d 1069</span>, 1071-1072, <span class=\"citation no-link\">236 Cal.Rptr. 891</span>.)</p>\n<p>Continuing the analogy of the procedure below to a nonsuit gives us guidance as to the standard of review to be applied on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> appeal. We \"must accept all facts asserted in the opening statement [or here, asserted in the best case scenario] as true and must indulge every legitimate inference which may be drawn from those facts. [Citations.] A nonsuit at this early stage of the proceedings is disfavored. [Citations.] It can only be upheld on appeal if, after accepting all the asserted facts as true and indulging every legitimate inference in favor of plaintiff, it can be said those facts and inferences lead inexorably to the conclusion plaintiff cannot establish an essential element of its cause of action....\" (<i>Adkins v. State of California</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\">50 Cal.App.4th 1802</span>, 1809, <span class=\"citation no-link\">59 Cal. Rptr.2d 59</span>; accord, <i>Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp.</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Cal.App.4th 15</span>, 28, <span class=\"citation no-link\">61 Cal.Rptr.2d 518</span>.) Accordingly, we accept Stein-Briefs best case scenario of the facts and apply them to the language of the various policies as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Duty to defend</i></h2>\n<p>All the insurers agreed to indemnify Stein-Brief against sums it might become <i>legally obligated to pay as damages</i> because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence or by personal injury arising out of wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of private occupancy. Stein-Brief admits the italicized language has been interpreted in California as covering tort but not contract liability. (<i>Stanford Ranch, Inc. v. Maryland Cos. Co.</i> (E.D.Cal.1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\">883 F.Supp. 493</span>, 496; <i>Fragomeno v. Insurance Co. of the West</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\">207 Cal.App.3d 822</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">255 Cal.Rptr. 111</span>.) It argues, however, that there is a potential for coverage where the insured performs its contractual duties in a negligent or otherwise tortious manner. Stein-Brief is mistaken.</p>\n<p>In <i>Stanford Ranch v. Maryland Casualty Company, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1766904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1766904/stanford-ranch-inc-v-maryland-cas-co/\">883 F.Supp. 493</a></span>, the underlying lawsuits involved a developer of single-family homes and its contracts with three subdevelopers. The agreements unraveled because of complications caused by the presence of wetlands and underground pools on the properties and the developer's failure to obtain the necessary permits and regulatory approval. The subdevelopers sued the developer for breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Reviewing California law, the court explained, \"[T]he issue is not whether a claim is framed in tort or in contract. The key question is whether the duty that gives rise to liability is independent of the contract or rests upon it. If liability stems from the contract, the policy will not cover any award even if some of the damages are based on tort claims arising from the contractual relationship.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 496; accord, <i>Wilmington Liquid Bulk Terminals, Inc. v. Somerset Marine Inc.</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Cal. App.4th 186</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">61 Cal.Rptr.2d 727</span>; <i>Loyola Marymount University v.

Koziol alleged Stein-Brief breached the Smallwood settlement agreement by failing to provide building plans for lot 6 in a timely manner and by misrepresenting its intent to enforce the building restriction on lot 5. Dickson alleged Stein-Brief breached its sales contract with her by failing to deliver a lot suitable for construction as represented. Without the contracts, Stein-Brief would have had no duty to either Koziol or Dickson.</p>\n<p>Stein-Brief argues Koziol's allegations of humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress (which included insomnia and tremors requiring medication) give rise to at least the potential of coverage under the \"bodily injury\" provision of the policies, thus triggering a duty to defend. But this issue was definitively resolved in <i>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\">11 Cal.4th 1</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">900 P.2d 619</span>.</p>\n<p><i>Waller</i> involved the question of coverage under a CGL policy for emotional and physical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> distress resulting from economic losses arising out of a shareholder power struggle. The underlying plaintiff alleged involuntary dissolution of the corporation, breaches of fiduciary, good faith and statutory duties, breach of contract, interference with prospective economic advantage, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against his fellow shareholders. The court characterized the underlying lawsuit as a business dispute and the alleged torts as business and contract transgressions, and held the acts complained of were not covered occurrences under the policy. Consequently, the emotional distress damages, having flowed from the noncovered acts, were not covered. \"These [CGL] policies were never intended to cover emotional distress damages that flow from an uncovered `occurrence,' and the parties could not reasonably have expected that coverage would be expanded merely because a claim of emotional or physical distress is alleged as a result of the <i>economic loss.</i> ... All allegations in the [shareholder's] complaint were related to [his] asserted <i>economic loss</i> as a... shareholder, and ... shareholder disputes are not covered by [the] policy.\" (11 Cal.4th at p. 23, <span class=\"citation no-link\">44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">900 P.2d 619</span>, first italics added; see also <i>American Internal Bank v.

Rptr.2d 368</span>.)</p>\n<p>Stein-Brief argues both the Koziol and Dickson complaints contain allegations sufficient to show the potential for coverage under the property damage provisions of the policies. Koziol claimed loss of use of the easement area on lot 6 and loss of use of both lot 5 and 6 due to Stein-Briefs breaches of the Smallwood settlement. Dickson claimed loss of use of her lot due to construction delays caused by the oversaturation of the land.</p>\n<p>Arguably, the alleged loss of use fits the policies' definition of property damage: \"loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed.\" But the property damage coverage is subject to the same analysis as bodily injury. Both must flow from a covered occurrence. \"Occurrence\" is defined as an accident or event resulting in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.<sup>[3]</sup> This definition \"focuses coverage on unexpected or accidental injuries that are fortuitous and not planned or intended. This concept of fortuity is basic to insurance law.\" <i>Waller v. Truck Insurance Exchange, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\">supra,</a></span></i> 11 Cal.4th at pp. 16-17, <span class=\"citation no-link\">44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">900 P.2d 619</span>, (italics omitted.) As discussed above, nonaccidental acts arising out of a breach of contract do not constitute an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of a CGL policy.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the delays and increased costs in home construction alleged here resulted in purely economic damages. In <i>American Internal Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.App.4th 1558</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">57 Cal.Rptr.2d 567</span>, the court found a claim against a lender for failure to make a home loan outside the coverage of the personal injury provisions. \"[T]heir inability to construct a dream home was not physical damage to the property, it was an inability to make `[a] valuable addition ... intended to enhance [their property's] value....' [Citation.]... [T]he inability to construct an improvement results in only economic loss. And `strictly economic losses like lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of the anticipated benefit of a bargain, and loss of an investment, do not constitute damage or injury to tangible property covered by a comprehensive general liability policy. [Citations.]' [Citation.]\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1572, <span class=\"citation no-link\">57 Cal.Rptr.2d 567</span>.)</p>\n<p>Stein-Brief argues both complaints present a potential for coverage under the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> provisions in the Home and Scottsdale policies providing coverage for personal injury arising out of wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.<sup>[4]</sup> Stein-Brief correctly points out personal injury coverage is not dependent on an occurrence, as is bodily injury and property damage coverage, but arises out of one or more offenses specified in the policy. (<i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. Co.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\">42 Cal.App.4th 95</span>, 103, <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal. Rptr.2d 603</span>.) But like bodily injury and property damage coverage, personal injury coverage is limited to tort damages, as discussed above. Thus, liability arising out of contractual duties is not contemplated by the CGL policy. (<i>Stanford Ranch, Inc. v. Maryland Cos. Co., supra,</i> 883 F.Supp. at p. 497.)</p>\n<p>This court had occasion to address the applicability of CGL personal injury coverage in <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">42 Cal.App.4th 95</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.Rptr.2d 603</span>. There, the underlying plaintiff became involved in a dispute with his fellow shareholders in an insurance agency business. Based on facts remarkably similar to those in <i>Waller</i><sup>[5]</sup> he alleged wrongful termination, breach of good faith and fiduciary duties, interference with contractual relations and prospective advantage, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He sought damages, the appointment of a receiver, and dissolution of the corporation. Pointing out that the \"wrongful entry\" language had been construed as applying to \"<i>tort</i> claims arising out of the interference with an interest in real property\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 103, <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.Rptr.2d 603</span>, italics added), we nevertheless found a potential for coverage, and thus a duty to defend, based on the discomfited shareholder's claims that he was ousted and ejected from the business premises, which was leased in his name as an individual. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 105, <span class=\"citation no-link\">49 Cal.Rptr.2d 603</span>.) These allegations referred to a breach of duty separate from the business relationship among the parties. (See <i>Aim Insurance Co. v. Culcasi</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">229 Cal.App.3d 209</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">280 Cal.Rptr. 766</span>; <i>Tinseltown Video, Inc. v. Transportation Ins. Co.</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\">61 Cal.App.4th 184</span>, 200, <span class=\"citation no-link\">71 Cal.Rptr.2d 371</span>.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither Koziol nor Dickson was occupying their properties when the alleged transgressions occurred; both were in the preconstruction stage. \"The term `other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" draws meaning and content from the preceding language: wrongful entry or eviction.' Such language connotes disruptions of the ability of a landowner to actually occupy his property, not mere injuries to property. [Citation.]\" (<i>Titan Corp. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal.App.4th 457</span>, 476, <span class=\"citation no-link\">27 Cal.Rptr.2d 476</span>.)</p>\n<p>Because neither the Koziol nor the Dickson complaints presented any potential for coverage under the policies, none of the insurers had a duty to defend. The trial court's judgment is affirmed. Respondents are entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p>SILLS, P.J., and CROSBY, J., concur.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Koziol sued Whitworth over this issue and eventually prevailed.</p>\n<p>[2]  Claiming Stein-Brief misquoted its policy language. National Union moved to produce its policies as additional evidence on appeal. Stein-Brief objected because National Union's proffered exhibits to its motion contained no declaration pages showing they were the actual policies in force during the applicable time periods. Stein-Brief submitted its version of the policies with declaration pages, asserting they were the actual policies from which it had accurately quoted. We accept both parties' versions of the policies, as suggested by Stein-Brief, and note that the minor discrepancies between the various versions have no bearing on our decision.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Home policy defined \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" National Union's policy defined \"occurrence\" as \"an event, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which result in Personal Injury or Property Damage during the policy period, neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\" Scottsdale's policy defined \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  The Home's 1989 policy provides personal injury must arise out of \"wrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies.\" National Union did not underwrite personal injury coverage.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Waller</i> did not address \"personal injury\" coverage.</p>\n\n</div>",

We reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Appellants operate a commercial nursery which produces and sells strawberry nursery stock to third party growers. A number of growers who purchased strawberry plants from appellants sued them, alleging that an aerially sprayed herbicide which causes systemic damage to strawberry plants drifted onto appellants' property' and stock of strawberry plants, which appellants then negligently sold to the growers.</p>\n<p>The growers' first cause of action for negligence alleges that appellants sold them the damaged plants even though appellants knew or should have known that the herbicide spray causes systemic damage to strawberry plants such that when replanted they die or become stunted. Growers' second cause of action for breach of warranty alleges that appellants breached an implied warranty that the plants were of good and merchantable quality. Growers' third cause of action for negligence alleges that when they began to suspect that appellants' plants were stunted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*624</span> and sought appellants' advice, appellants negligently advised them not to replant their fields with unaffected plants, and informed them that the stunted plants would eventually produce a \"near normal\" yield. In reliance thereon, growers \"for the most part\" refrained from replanting their fields with healthy plants and were damaged by a loss of production from the stunted plants.</p>\n<p>Appellants were insured under two of Zurich's liability policies for the period during which the incident occurred: (1) a primary policy which provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage; and (2) an excess policy which provides excess coverage over the primary policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Primary Policy</i></h2>\n<p>Appellants' primary policy provides coverage for \"those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance applies ... caused by an `occurrence.'\" An \"`occurrence' [is defined] as an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" \"`Property damage' [is defined as]: [\u00b6] a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property; or [\u00b6] b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Excess Policy</i></h2>\n<p>Appellants' excess policy generally incorporates the primary policy's insuring language, providing excess coverage for claims covered under the primary policy, and primary coverage for claims the primary policy does not cover. It provides that \"[\u00b6] 1. When primary insurance or other insurance is available, we: [\u00b6] a. have the right and opportunity to defend, but not the obligation; and [\u00b6] b. can defend any claim or suit which may create liability under this policy. [\u00b6] 2. We will assume settlement or defense of claims or suits where: [\u00b6] a. the limits of liability of the primary insurance are exhausted by payment of claims; or [\u00b6] b. damages are sought for ... property damage... claims or suits, covered by this policy, and for which no primary insurance or other insurance applies.\" (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p>After Zurich refused to defend appellants in the growers' action, appellants filed the instant action against Zurich, alleging generally that Zurich breached its obligations under the policies to defend and indemnify them against the growers' claims. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of Zurich's duty to defend against the growers' claims, and alternatively moved for summary adjudication of issues.</p>\n<p>Zurich's motion for summary judgment was based, in relevant part, on its contention that: (1) the growers' complaint does not allege covered property damage; (2) appellants' potential liability is purely contractual; and (3) aircraft exclusions in both policies apply to the growers' claims.</p>\n<p>The court denied appellants' motion and granted summary judgment for Zurich, ruling that (1) appellants' liability to the growers is based entirely upon its contractual duties; and (2) Zurich's policies do not cover the damages sought in the growers' action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Appellants contend the claims asserted in the growers' action establish a potential for coverage under Zurich's policies, giving rise to a duty to defend. They argue that the policies covered the growers' action under the provisions concerning liability for property damage, and that the growers' complaint sounds in tort rather than contract, as Zurich claims.</p>\n<p>A defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of negating an essential element of the plaintiffs cause of action, or establishing a complete defense thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (<i>o</i>); <i>Campanano v. California Medical Center</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, and an insurer may owe a duty to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*625</span> defend its insured in an action in which no damages are ultimately awarded. Whether the insurer owes a duty to defend is determined by comparing the factual allegations of the complaint and the extrinsic facts known to the insurer with the terms of the policy. (<i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v.

If a single issue exists which is even potentially within the policy coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured against a third-party action in its entirety. (<i>Buss v. Superior Court</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239173/buss-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 48, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Any doubt as to whether the facts give rise to a duty to defend is resolved in favor of the insured. (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v.

Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Like all contracts, an insurance policy is interpreted to effectuate the mutual intent of the parties. That intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the provisions of the policy itself. (Civ.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1639; <i>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 821-822, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The clear and explicit meaning of contract provisions, interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense, controls our interpretation, unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special meaning is ascribed to them by usage. Courts apply the meaning a lay-person would ascribe to the clear and unambiguous language of an insurance contract. (<i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 666-667, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(<i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 10 Cal.4th at p. 667, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under the primary policy Zurich agreed to provide coverage for \"those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... `property damage' to which this insurance applies ... caused by `an occurrence.'\" \"`Occurrence' [is defined as] an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\"</p>\n<p>Appellants contend the covered occurrences under the policies were (1) their negligent sale of damaged strawberry plants to the growers, and later (2) their negligent advice to the growers, which caused them to refrain from removing the damaged plants and replacing them with healthy ones. Zurich has ignored the occurrence issue. On appeal it argues only that (1) the growers do not allege any covered property damage, (2) appellants' liability is purely contractual and therefore not covered, and (3) the aircraft exclusions in the policies apply to the growers' claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellants contend the policies potentially covered the growers' action under the coverage for property damage. As noted, the policies define \"property damage,\" in relevant part, as: \"a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property; or [\u00b6] b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" The clear and unambiguous meaning of this definition is that loss of use of tangible property is distinct from physical injury to the property in question and is not limited to losses caused by or relating to some physical injury of the property. (See <i>Borg v. Transamerica Ins. Co.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></span>, 456-457, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span> </span>(<i>Borg)</i><i>.</i>)</p>\n<p>In essence, the growers' first cause of action alleges that appellants' negligent sale of defective plants resulted in lost strawberry production. The parties agree that the damaged plants do not themselves constitute property damage under the policy. However, appellants urge that the growers' complaint can reasonably be construed as alleging <span class=\"star-pagination\">*626</span> that the defective plants caused \"both physical injury to tangible property and [a] loss of use of tangible property which is not physically injured,\" for which the policies provide coverage. Zurich rejoins that appellants do not allege a loss of use of property, but claim only economic losses associated with the property, which does not constitute property damage.</p>\n<p>In support of their loss of use argument appellants rely on <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Borg,</span> supra</span>,</i> where the insured purchased residential property which included a deck that encroached on an adjoining vacant lot. Thereafter, the third party claimant purchased the adjoining lot and sued the insured for damages and an injunction to remove the encroaching deck. He alleged that the deck's encroachment rendered his property not saleable and claimed damages for loss of use of the property encroached upon. (47 Cal.App.4th at p. 452, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>The policy in <i>Borg,</i> as here, defined \"loss of use\" as limited to loss of use of tangible property not physically injured. <i>Borg</i> stated, \"This term is meant to exclude intangible economic interests and property rights. It has been defined in its plain and ordinary sense as limited to property having physical substance apparent to the senses, including real estate. [Citations.]\" <i>Borg</i> concluded that the third party complaint created a potential for coverage for loss of use damage by alleging that the insured's deck encroached upon and resulted in a loss of use of his neighbor's real property. (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Borg,</span> supra</span>,</i> 47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 457-458, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>Although we have found no California cases dealing with loss of use of fields in which defective crops were planted, cases outside of California are instructive. In <i>Economy Mills of Elwell, Inc. v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co.</i> (1967) 8 Mich.App. 451 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1646626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1646626/economy-mills-of-elwell-inc-v-motorists-mutual-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 660-661] (<i>Economy Mills</i>), the insured, a seller of grain and seeds, was protected under a policy in which the insured agreed to pay sums which the insured was legally obligated to pay as damages due to injury to or destruction of physical property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident. While the policy was in effect, the insured sold various Michigan growers cranberry seed beans. The growers sued the insured claiming breach of implied warranties involved in the sale of the seed beans which were allegedly defective because they were not of a type suitable to Michigan's growing season and therefore, although properly planted and maintained, did not flower, pod and mature. The growers claimed damages for various items of loss suffered in purchasing, planting and cultivating a bean crop that did not mature, including the loss of use of the land for that year's growing season.</p>\n<p><i>Economy <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1646626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1646626/economy-mills-of-elwell-inc-v-motorists-mutual-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mills,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> first determined that the failure of the seed beans to mature was unforeseen, unexpected and unintended and therefore constituted an accident under the policy. It then held that the loss of use of land for the purpose of growing a crop constituted property damage under the policy's loss of use clause. (154 N.W.2d at pp. 661-662, 664.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Safeco Insurance Company v. Munroe</i> (1974) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"875788\"><a href=\"/opinion/875788/safeco-insurance-company-v-munroe/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 66, 68-69 the insured was protected under a policy covering loss of use of property resulting from injury to or destruction of tangible property caused by ah occurrence. The third party complaint alleged that the insured mistakenly delivered the wrong type of wheat seed, resulting in crop loss and loss of use of the wheat fields for the crop season. The Montana Supreme Court held that if as a result of receiving the wrong seed little or no wheat grew, the growers would have received little or no compensation due to having lost a crop and would thereby have suffered a loss of use of their lands, constituting property damage under the policy.</p>\n<p>Here, the growers' complaint may reasonably be construed as alleging that as a result of appellants' negligent delivery of defective plants, the growers suffered a loss of strawberry production, and thereby a loss of the use of their land. The policies in this case expressly state that \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured\" constitutes \"property damage.\" Thus, we conclude that the growers' action presents a potential for coverage which requires a defense. Contrary to respondents' arguments, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*627</span> the alleged loss of profits or diminution in property value are not solely economic losses, but damages because of property damage, and therefore constituted alternative measures of any property damage allegedly sustained.

Serlin for Defendant and Respondent.</p>\n<p>OPINION</p>\n<p>YEGAN, J.</p>\n<p>Here we hold that an insurance company has no duty to defend a civil action charging the insured with participation in a conspiracy to engage in fraudulent billing practices. We reach this conclusion because the policy limited coverage to third party claims for bodily injury and damage to tangible property.</p>\n<p>William Hurley, doing business as Hurley Construction Company (Hurley), appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of respondent, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm), on an action for breach of an insurance contract. Hurley contends the trial court erred when it found that the comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by State Farm provided no coverage. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p>Hurley was a general contractor who furnished insurance repair services to the owners of homes and businesses insured by Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (Fireman's Fund). Fireman's Fund filed suit against Hurley for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract based on the allegation that Hurley conspired with a Fireman's Fund property claims supervisor, Candido, and other contractors to overcharge for the repair and restoration of four properties. (L.A. Super. Ct. No. NWC 29762.)</p>\n<p>Paragraph 25 of the complaint, in pertinent part, succintly states Fireman's Fund's theory: \"The insurance fraud scheme was a wheel conspiracy to defraud Fireman's Fund. Candido ... formed the hub of the conspiracy. The remaining defendants ... [including Hurley] were spokes of the conspiracy and were joint-venturers in the scheme to defraud Fireman's Fund.\" Hurley allegedly charged inflated prices, paid kickbacks to Candido, performed substandard work, used improper materials, and billed for services never performed.</p>\n<p>Hurley tendered defense of the case to State Farm. State Farm denied coverage, prompting Hurley's counsel to send eight demand letters between July and December of 1987. Hurley's counsel believed the Fireman's Fund action could potentially become an action for property damage and bodily injury, thereby triggering coverage. State Farm still denied coverage.</p>\n<p>Hurley was required to finance his own defense, which he claims led to his bankruptcy. In 1988 Hurley filed the present action against State Farm alleging separate causes of action for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p>Attached to Hurley's complaint is a copy of State Farm's comprehensive general liability insurance policy. The insuring clause states that State Farm will pay on behalf of Hurley \"... all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of [\u00b6] A. bodily injury or [\u00b6] B. property damage [\u00b6] to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence....\" The policy defines an \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured....\" \"Property damage\" is defined to mean the physical injury or destruction of tangible property.</p>\n<p>State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication of issues contending it had no duty to defend because (1) the Fireman's Fund complaint did not seek compensation for property damage or bodily injury, (2) the alleged damages did not arise out of an occurrence as defined by the policy, (3) the policy did not insure against claims for fraud or negligent misrepresentation, and (4) the policy did not insure against claims arising out of contractual obligations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> Hurley opposed the motion, citing the eight demand letters sent to State Farm in 1987. The trial court determined that no triable material facts existed because Hurley admitted all of the facts set forth in State Farm's separate statement of undisputed facts. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).) (1) Where, as here, the facts are not in dispute, it is the appellate court's duty to make an independent determination of insurance coverage. (<i>State Farm Mut.

Although an insurer's duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, the duty to defend depends upon <i>facts</i> known to the insurer at the inception of the suit.

The extraneous \"facts\" regarding potential liability came from Hurley's counsel who speculated about how Fireman's Fund might amend its complaint at some future date. Hurley, however, misconstrued the concept of \"potential liability\" as defined by the policy. (3b) \"We look to the nature and kind of risk covered by the policy as a limitation upon the duty to defend....\" (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 275; see also <i>Giddings</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>(2c) Our Supreme Court, anticipating imaginative counsel and the likelihood of artful drafting, has indicated that a third party is not the arbiter of the policy's coverage. (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276; see also <i>Fire Ins.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>].) A corollary to this rule is that the insured may not speculate about unpled third party claims to manufacture coverage.</p>\n<p>Here, the trial court reasonably concluded that the action filed by Fireman's Fund involved no potential claim for property damage or bodily <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> injury. We too are unwilling to characterize the straightforward provisions of the policy to find coverage where none exists. (<i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Great American Ins. Companies</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span>, 778 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112849/nichols-v-great-american-ins-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>The underlying complaint alleged that Hurley conspired with Fireman's Fund's own claims supervisor to defraud Fireman's Fund from 1983 and 1986. These allegations, read in connection with the insuring and exclusionary clauses in the State Farm policy, preclude coverage. Our conclusion is based on two interrelated coverage factors.</p>\n<p>First, the insuring clause limited coverage to an accidental \"occurrence.\" This was the triggering event. No duty to defend arose unless the third party claim involved an \"occurrence\" neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>].) Since the Fireman's Fund complaint was predicated on the allegation that Hurley conspired to engage in fraudulent billing practices, none of the damages asserted arose from an accidental \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the insuring clause. \"An intentional act is not an `accident' within the plain meaning of the word. [Citations.]\" (<i>Royal Globe Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Whitaker</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></span>, 537 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123679\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123679/royal-globe-ins-co-v-whitaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>], fn. omitted.) Any insured who participates in a conspiracy to defraud, as here alleged, cannot reasonably expect insurance coverage based upon the intentionally created \"occurrence.\"</p>\n<p>Second, the policy limited coverage to property or bodily injury damages. The Fireman's Fund complaint only sought economic and punitive damages. It sought no damages for bodily injury or destruction of tangible property owned by Fireman's Fund. Since the insuring clause was limited to third party claims for bodily injury and property damage, Hurley had no reasonable expectation of coverage. (<i>Giddings</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 112 Cal. App.3d at p. 219; <i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Fid. &amp; Guar.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span>].)</p>\n<p>(4) Alternatively, Hurley argues that the Fireman's Fund complaint was a subrogation action in disguise. No facts, however, were alleged to suggest that Fireman's Fund was attempting to recover money paid its insureds for property damages or personal injuries. (<i>Caito</i> v. <i>United California Bank</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2603839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2603839/caito-v-united-california-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 704 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2603839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2603839/caito-v-united-california-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

After three years of litigation, Hurley produced no discovery, declarations, or pleadings to support his belief that Fireman's Fund was pursuing a phantom subrogation claim.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> We also reject the argument that Hurley's self-serving letters to State Farm bridged the coverage gap. State Farm reasonably concluded that it had no duty to defend until the property owners filed their own actions for property damages or personal injuries. Hurley's August 21, 1987, and September 15, 1987, demand letters conceded as much. Both letters noted that State Farm, consistent with the policy issued to Hurley, was defending him in an Orange County action filed by Fireman's Fund insureds, Edward and Sally Pinchot. The fact that State Farm honored its policy to defend Hurley on the Pinchot claim does not mean that it was also obligated to defend against the fraud action filed by Fireman's Fund in Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p>(5) Hurley, however, argues that the Fireman's Fund action could have involved a breach of warranty claim because he allegedly used substandard materials and failed to complete the repairs in a workmanlike manner. He cites the breach of warranty exception in the exclusion section of the policy which states: \"This insurance does not apply: [\u00b6] (a) to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement except an incidental contract; but this exclusion does not apply to a warranty of fitness or quality of the named insured's products or a warranty that work performed by or on behalf of the named insured will be done in a workmanlike manner....\"</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, an exception to a policy exclusion does not create coverage not otherwise available under the coverage clause. (<i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Coss</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></span>, 896 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144906\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144906/st-paul-fire-marine-ins-co-v-coss/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>].) Here, the warranty language appearing in the exclusions section of the policy covered only bodily injury or property damage resulting from a defective product or poor workmanship. (<i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Fid &amp; Guar. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 76 Cal. App.3d at p. 281.)</p>\n<p>Any attempt to bootstrap coverage based on the breach of warranty exception is specious. Unlike the facts presented in <i>Economy Lumber Co.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">America,</span> supra</span>,</i> 157 Cal. App.3d at page 649, Hurley did not seek indemnification after settling the third party property damage claims. Moreover, Hurley concedes that all repair work was performed for the property owner, not Fireman's Fund. If so, Fireman's Fund could not assert a claim for breach of warranty since it purchased no materials or services. (<i>Aced</i> v. <i>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co.</i> (1961) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></span>, 580 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Law (9th ed 1987) Sales, \u00a7 52, p. 48.)</p>\n<p>(6) Finally, Hurley argues that no competent evidence was presented to support the summary judgment. He asserts that the supporting declaration of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> State Farm's attorney was inadmissible and lacked foundation. The argument is without merit. Hurley admitted each of the facts listed in State Farm's separate statement of undisputed facts. In doing so, he waived any objection to the exhibits, discovery responses, and deposition testimony which formed the evidentiary basis of State Farm's separate statement. (See <i>United Community Church</i> v. <i>Garcin</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></span>, 336-337 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span>].)</p>\n<p>(2d) In sum, no triable issue of material fact was presented because the potential for recovery was limited to intangible economic interests and property rights. (<i>Warner</i> v. <i>Fire Ins. Exchange</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></span>, 1036 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2114712\"><a href=\"/opinion/2114712/warner-v-fire-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>].) By no stretch of the imagination can a civil action for conspiracy to engage in fraudulent billing practices be deemed to be a claim for accidental bodily injury or property damage. (<i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Interbank Financial Services</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We conclude that, in the context of the policy as a whole, the insurer does have such an obligation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On March 10, 1995, 16-year-old Kelly S. and some of his friends were at Kelly's home when Kelly found a .22-caliber Beretta handgun in his mother's coat pocket. Kelly's father had taught him how to handle a 9-millimeter Beretta. Taking the same precautions he would have taken to unload a 9-millimeter Beretta, Kelly removed the clip from the handle of the .22-caliber Beretta, placed the clip on a table, and pulled back the slide on the gun. Believing the gun to be unloaded, Kelly pulled the trigger. The gun fired, killing his friend, Christopher Mitchell.</p>\n<p>A petition alleging Kelly's commission of involuntary manslaughter, a felony (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)), was filed in juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst.Code, \u00a7 602). The court sustained the petition, made Kelly a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*848</span> ward of the court, and placed him on probation.</p>\n<p>Timothy and Christy Mitchell, the parents of Christopher, brought a wrongful death action against Kelly and his parents, who tendered defense of the action to Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco) under their homeowners insurance policy. Safeco undertook the defense under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p>Safeco then brought this action in superior court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify its insureds because the policy excluded coverage for an \"illegal act.\" Named as defendants were the insureds and the Mitchells. Safeco unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment, contending that the accidental killing of Christopher fell within the policy exclusion for an \"illegal act.\"</p>\n<p>Thereafter Christy Mitchell, joined by the insureds, moved for summary judgment contending that Safeco as a matter of law had a duty to defend and indemnify. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the policy's \"illegal act\" exclusion could reasonably be interpreted as excluding coverage only for an <i>intentional</i> illegal act. The court found it was \"undisputed that Kelly S[.] did not intend to cause harm to Mitchell's son [and] that [Kelly] did not intend to commit an unlawful or `illegal' act.\" Accordingly, the court ruled that the Mitchells' wrongful death claim was potentially covered by the insureds' policy, giving rise to Safeco's duty to defend. Safeco appealed.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's judgment. Relying on a dictionary definition of \"illegal\" as meaning \"not according to or authorized by law; unlawful,\" the Court of Appeal concluded that the illegal act exclusion in the policy precluded coverage for any act in violation of civil or criminal law, whether or not the person committing the act intended to cause harm or to violate the law, but that it did not exclude coverage for ordinary civil negligence. Applying this understanding of the scope of the policy's illegal act exclusion, the court held that the policy did not provide coverage for an act causing death that resulted in a juvenile court adjudication of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p>We granted the separate petitions for review filed by the insureds and Christy Mitchell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The homeowners policy at issue here covered the period June 30, 1994, through June 30, 1995. The accidental shooting occurred in March 1995. Under the terms of the policy, Kelly and his parents are insureds.</p>\n<p>Relevant here are these policy provisions: Safeco agreed to defend and indemnify the insureds in the event of claims brought against any insured for bodily injury caused by \"an occurrence,\" which the policy defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury during the policy period. Excluded from coverage was liability for bodily injury \"arising out of any <i>illegal act</i> committed by or at the direction of an insured.\" (Italics added.) The policy did not define the term \"illegal act.\"</p>\n<p>We now turn to the task of stating the controlling principles of insurance contract interpretation and applying them to the policy here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Insurance policies are contracts and therefore subject to the rules of construction governing contracts.

The phrase \"illegal act\" is susceptible of two reasonable meanings. As mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal, relying on a dictionary definition, construed the term broadly, as meaning any act prohibited by law. But the term can also be interpreted more narrowly as meaning a violation of criminal law. This is the construction Safeco urges us to adopt. Certain thesauruses do treat the term \"illegal\" as synonymous with \"criminal.\" (See, e.g., Burton, Legal Thesaurus (1980) p. 257 [stating that \"against the law\" and \"criminal\" are synonyms of \"illegal\"]; Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus (1976) p. 414 [stating that \"criminal\" is a synonym of \"illegal\"].) If we were to adopt this meaning in the context of the policy here, we would have to treat the policy's clause excluding coverage for an \"illegal act\" as the equivalent of a clause excluding coverage for a \"criminal act.\"</p>\n<p>The policy before us, however, contains not a <i>criminal act</i> exclusion but an <i>illegal act</i> exclusion. Had Safeco wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage, it could have easily done so. Insurers commonly insert an exclusion for criminal acts in their liability policies. (Croskey &amp; Kaufman, Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2000) \u00b6\u00b6 7:331.5, 7:2256, pp. 7A-86, 71-23 (rev. # 1, 2000).) Because Safeco chose not to have a criminal act exclusion, instead opting for an illegal act exclusion, we cannot read into the policy what Safeco has omitted. To do so would violate the fundamental principle that in interpreting contracts, including insurance contracts, courts are not to insert what has been omitted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <i>Jensen v. Traders &amp; General Ins. Co.</i> (1959) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></span>, 790, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>; <i>Jacobson v.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span>.)<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*850</span> We now consider the Court of Appeal's construction of the term \"illegal\" as meaning violation of <i>any</i> law, whether civil or criminal. (See, e.g., Webster's 9th New Collegiate Diet. (1989) p. 599 [\"not according to or authorized by law; unlawful\"]; Webster's New World Diet. (2d college ed.1982) p. 699 [\"prohibited by law; against the law; unlawful; illicit; also, not authorized or sanctioned, as by rules\"]; Black's Law Diet. (5th ed.1979) p. 673, col. 2 [\"against or not authorized by law\"]; see Evid.Code, \u00a7 160 [\"`Law' includes constitutional, statutory, and decisional law\"].) That construction, however, is so broad as to render the policy's liability coverage practically meaningless.</p>\n<p>For instance, a violation of \"any law\" would include the law governing negligence, which holds individuals responsible for the failure to exercise ordinary care resulting in injury to another. (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1714 [\"Every one is responsible . . . for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill. . . .\"].) The duty to exercise ordinary care is imposed by law. (See <i>Sharon P. v. Arman, Ltd.</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1253982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1253982/sharon-p-v-arman-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1188-1189, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1253982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1253982/sharon-p-v-arman-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A violation of that duty is therefore <i>a violation of law.</i> Broadly construed, a violation of <i>any</i> law, whether civil or criminal, is an illegal act. An insured's negligent act, being a violation of law and therefore <i>an illegal act,</i> would thus not be covered under Safeco's policy excluding coverage for an insured's illegal acts.</p>\n<p>But the homeowners policy that the insureds here bought from Safeco expressly provided that Safeco would defend and indemnify them for bodily injury caused by \"an occurrence,\" which the policy defines as \"an accident . . . which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage.\" Because the term \"accident\" is more comprehensive than the term \"negligence\" and thus includes negligence (Black's Law Diet., <i>supra,</i> at p. 14, col. 2), Safeco's homeowners policy promised coverage for liability resulting from the insured's negligent acts. That promise would be rendered illusory if, as discussed above, we were to construe the phrase \"illegal act,\" as contained in the policy's exclusionary clause, to mean violation of any law, whether criminal or civil. When reasonably practical, contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect, and that is consistent with the parties' intent. (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1643; see <i>Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196180\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196180/palmer-v-truck-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span>, 1115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196180\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196180/palmer-v-truck-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

After stating that the exclusion was not limited to liability arising out of a criminal conviction or criminal act, the Court of Appeal stated that \"while the failure to exercise ordinary care may result in the imposition of an obligation to provide compensation for any loss caused by one's negligence, such failure to exercise ordinary care is not `illegal.'\" It then concluded that the \"specific act at issue in the present case, involuntary manslaughter, falls into an entirely different category, involving as it did gross negligence and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*851</span> the commission of a punishable, public offense.\" We disagree with that analysis.</p>\n<p>It is not clear how the Court of Appeal defined the word \"illegal\" as it is used in the exclusionary clause. If the Court of Appeal construed the exclusionary clause as excluding every offense, that is, every crime, it defines the word \"illegal\" as meaning \"criminal.\" As we have seen, that definition is inappropriate here because it rewrites the policy by inserting what has been omitted. Drawing a distinction, as the Court of Appeal did, between negligent acts and grossly negligent acts exceeds the bounds of construction by rewriting the policy. The word \"illegal\" is not a synonym for \"gross negligence.\"</p>\n<p>As we noted earlier, \"ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds' favor, consistent with the insureds' reasonable expectations.\" (<i>Kazi v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 24 Cal.4th at p. 879, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

An insured should not be expected to know the subtle legal distinctions between the concepts of ordinary negligence and gross negligence. Such distinctions are not objectively within the reasonable expectations of the insured.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Also, to draw a distinction between negligent and grossly negligent acts, as the Court of Appeal did, would be at odds with Insurance Code section 533. Under that provision, an \"insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured; but he is not exonerated by the <i>negligence</i> of the insured. . . .\" (<i>Ibid.,</i> italics added.) The statute does not distinguish between ordinary and gross negligence. Therefore, an insurer intending to exclude from a homeowner's policy coverage for gross negligence would have to say so in express terms, instead of, as here, using the ambiguous phrase \"illegal act.\" The \"`burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.'\" (<i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Jacober</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451504/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-jacober/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 202, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451504/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-jacober/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Safeco's view leaves the exclusionary clause without meaning until after an event has occurred. This violates the rule that expectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made. (Civ.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1649; <i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 10 Cal.4th at p. 666, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213751/montrose-chemical-corp-v-admiral-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Moreover, an insured's objectively reasonable expectations are measured not by an insured's knowledge of the nuances of criminal law, but by what an insured would expect to be covered by the policy. The proper inquiry is: Would reasonable insureds expect their homeowners policy to protect them against liability for accidental injury or death occurring in their home? The answer is yes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*852</span> In short, because the illegal act exclusion cannot reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract, it must be rejected as invalid. (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1653.)</p>\n<p>Finally, we reject Safeco's contention that Civil Code section 1668 relieves it of any duty to indemnify the insureds for liability resulting from Kelly's accidental killing of Christopher Mitchell. Section 1668 provides: \"All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\" Section 1668 applies to contractual exemptions from liability, not to indemnity contracts. (<i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Eddy</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></span>, 967, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span>, 278-279,124 Cal. Rptr. 388.) An insurance policy is an indemnity contract. (Ins.Code, \u00a7 22.) Thus, section 1668 simply does not apply here.</p>\n<p>For the reasons given above, we conclude that the Mitchells' wrongful death action is within the liability coverage of the homeowners policy at issue here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Disposition</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed with directions to enter judgment affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p>GEORGE, C.J., WERDEGAR, J., and CHIN, J., concur.</p>\n<p>Concurring and dissenting opinion by BAXTER, J.</p>\n<p>Though my reasons differ from the majority's, I agree with their conclusion that the \"illegal act\" exclusion in Safeco's policy did not deprive Kelly S.'s <i>parents</i> of liability coverage for their son's fatal shooting of Christopher Mitchell. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's determination that, despite the policy's explicit refusal to cover an insured for his or her \"illegal act,\" the policy nonetheless covered <i>Kelly himself</i> for his criminal homicide.</p>\n<p>On the latter point, I accept, for purposes of argument, that an \"illegal act\" could mean something <i>broader</i> than a \"criminal act,\" a more common form of coverage exclusion. There may be situations that would strain the outer limits of an illegal act exclusion in a policy designed to afford coverage for accidental injuries. Finally, I do not doubt that all reasonable uncertainty about the phrase's meaning must be resolved against the insurer, that drafted the policy, and in favor of coverage a policyholder would reasonably expect. Hence, I am satisfied that the illegal act exclusion cannot contravene the parties' basic understanding that coverage would be afforded for an insured's ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p>But Kelly cannot benefit from even the <i>narrowest</i> reasonable interpretation of the illegal act exclusion. An exclusion for illegal acts must apply wherever a criminal act exclusion would apply; any criminal act is also illegal, and no layperson would understand otherwise. Moreover, even if the meaning of \"illegal\" might be uncertain when applied to particular facts, it cannot be so here. An illegal act exclusion must at least have been intended, and understood, to withdraw liability coverage from an insured who, by recklessly pointing and shooting a loaded firearm, committed the grave felony offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p>Such a conclusion does not undermine the purposes of an insurance policy intended to afford liability coverage for accidental injuries. Nor does it defeat the insured's reasonable expectations of coverage. A policyholder found guilty of criminal homicide under such circumstances could hardly expect that his or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*853</span> her tort liability for the killing somehow falls outside an explicit exclusion for \"illegal acts.\"</p>\n<p>The majority discount a recent Court of Appeal decision, <i>20th Century Ins. Co. v. Stewart</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span> </a></span>(<i>20th Century</i>), that illustrates this point. There, during a party, 19-year-old Matthew Guglietti, while intoxicated, took a revolver from his parents' bedroom and inserted one bullet. He pointed the gun at a friend and pulled the trigger, then pointed the gun at his own head and pulled the trigger again. The next day, as the party continued, Guglietti, still intoxicated, retrieved the revolver. He pointed the gun at victim DiGeronimo and pulled the trigger once more. The weapon discharged, wounding DiGeronimo fatally. To avoid murder charges, Guglietti pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter with personal use of a firearm.</p>\n<p>Edwina Stewart, DiGeronimo's mother, sued Guglietti for wrongful death. Guglietti, an insured under his parents' homeowners policy, tendered his defense to the insurer. The policy excluded coverage for injury foreseeably resulting from an insured's \"criminal act.\" (<i>20th <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Century,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thereafter, the insurer won a declaratory judgment that no coverage was afforded.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal affirmed. As the court explained, \"Stewart contends the [p]olicy's criminal act exclusion is ambiguous\" (<i>20th <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Century,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As the court noted, Guglietti's action had resulted in his conviction of a serious felony, eliminating any doubt whether the conduct at issue came within the meaning of \"criminal act\" as used in the policy. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>Moreover, the court observed, even if the exclusion might be deemed ambiguous, there could be \"no reasonable expectation that the [p]olicy covered liability for Guglietti's killing of DiGeronimo. Stewart posits that the criminal act of . . . manslaughter is based on and really nothing more than negligence and that an insured would reasonably expect the [p]olicy would cover injury caused by an insured's negligence. [\u00b6] [But] Stewart's characterization of Guglietti's action as . . . based or premised on [mere] negligence trivializes his conduct. This is not a case in which a [firearm] was negligently mishandled and fired by mistake or inadvertence. Guglietti deliberately and intentionally pointed the revolver at DiGeronimo and deliberately and intentionally pulled the trigger. . . . [\u00b6] Under these circumstances we conclude the insured could not reasonably have expected the [p]olicy's coverage for injury caused by negligence to have covered Guglietti's criminal act.\" (<i>20th <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Century,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In a juvenile proceeding instituted for that purpose, it was found beyond reasonable doubt that Kelly's act constituted the serious felony offense of manslaughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 192, 193.) As noted above, when the killing of another is adjudged a serious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*854</span> violation of the <i>penal law,</i> an ordinary layperson would certainly understand the conduct to be <i>illegal.</i></p>\n<p>For similar reasons, Kelly had no reasonable expectation that, despite the exclusion for \"illegal act[s],\" he was covered for his criminal homicide. Urging the contrary, defendants suggest the tragedy was simply a negligent accident, in that Kelly tried to unload the weapon, thought he had disabled it, and intended no harm. But, as in <i>20th Century,</i> this characterization trivializes the seriousness of the unlawful conduct at issue. Here, as there, the victim was not killed by the mere negligent mishandling of a gun that caused it to fire inadvertently. Instead, it is undisputed that Kelly brandished the gun, pointed it in the general direction of Christopher's head, and deliberately pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p>Even if Kelly thought the weapon was unloaded and intended no injury, he committed a wilful and potentially lethal act without \"due caution and circumspection\" (Pen.Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)). Because of the obvious danger, it is universal knowledge that one must never engage the firing mechanism of a gun while aiming it anywhere near another human being. Laypersons also know it is a serious crime to injure or kill another by the reckless mishandling of a firearm. In the face of an exclusion for illegal acts, Kelly's expectation that the policy covered his ordinary negligence could not include the reasonable belief that he would be covered for his reckless shooting of Christopher, which led to an adjudication he was guilty of the felony of manslaughter.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority decline to accept this logic, and therefore to find the exclusion applicable to Kelly. Instead, they conclude that because the illegal act exclusion might be difficult to apply in <i>some</i> factual situations, it is simply null and void in <i>every</i> case, including one where its application is beyond debate.</p>\n<p>The majority offer meager support for this sweeping conclusion. They suggest that to apply the exclusionary clause to these facts, when its meaning might be uncertain in other cases, would violate the rule that \"expectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made. (Civ.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1649; <i>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins.

Not so. As indicated above, from the inception of the contract, an insured could only have expected that the illegal act exclusion would bar coverage for his or her criminally reckless homicide resulting in a conviction for manslaughter. Contrary to the majority's assertion, a lay policyholder was not required to appreciate \"subtle legal distinctions\" to reach that understanding. (<i>Id.,</i> 110 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 851, 28 P.3d at p. 895.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*855</span> The majority posit that \"because the illegal act exclusion cannot reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract, it must be rejected as invalid. (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1653.)\" (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 110 Cal.Rptr.2d at p. 851, 28 P.3d at p. 895.) The cited statute\u0097the only authority the majority provide for this proposition\u0097states the unremarkable maxim that \"[w]ords in a contract which are wholly inconsistent with its nature, or with the main intention of the parties, are to be rejected.\" (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1653.) The majority fail to show how interpreting the illegal act exclusion to bar coverage for the felony of manslaughter, committed by the wilful and reckless misuse of a deadly weapon, would give the clause a meaning \"wholly inconsistent\" with the nature of the contract or the \"main intention of the parties.\"</p>\n<p>In another context, the majority insist that courts cannot insert in an insurance contract what the parties have omitted. (Maj. opn., <i>ante,</i> 110 Cal.Rptr.2d at pp. 849, 851, 28 P.3d at pp. 893, 895.) But by <i>omitting</i> what was <i>expressly inserted and agreed upon,</i> the majority do equal damage to the parties' intent and expectations.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I cannot join the majority's strained effort to avoid applying the exclusionary clause to Kelly's commission of manslaughter. With respect to coverage for Kelly personally, I would affirm the Court of Appeal's determination that judgment should be entered for Safeco.</p>\n<p>I reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to any liability of Kelly's <i>parents</i> for the fatal shooting. They committed no reckless homicide and were found guilty of no crime. The causes of action against them for Christopher's wrongful death relied solely on allegations of then-negligent supervision, control, and maintenance of Kelly\u0097in other words, the alleged breach of their duty of ordinary care.</p>\n<p>As indicated above, the illegal act exclusion could not apply <i>directly</i> to the mere negligent acts or omissions of Kelly's parents. Such a broad interpretation of \"illegal\" would defeat the reasonable expectation that a policy promising to pay bodily injury damages \"for which the insured is <i>legally liable</i>\" (italics added) at least covers liability for an accidental injury arising from his or her ordinary negligence. Safeco does not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>However, Safeco urges that the particular language of the exclusionary clause withdraws coverage from Kelly's parents for any claim based on <i>Kelly's</i> illegal act. As Safeco notes, the clause states that the policy's coverage is inapplicable to liability \"arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of <i>an</i> insured.\" (Italics added.) Safeco insists that the reference to \"an\" insured bars <i>all</i> policyholders from coverage for liability related to the illegal act of any of them.</p>\n<p>It is true that in policies with multiple insureds, the cases have distinguished clauses that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to \"the\" insured from those that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to \"an\" or \"any\" insured. Absent contrary evidence, the former language is considered singular and specific, so that one insured remains covered despite facts that exclude coverage for another, while the latter is considered plural and indefinite, so that if particular facts exclude coverage for one or more insureds, they exclude coverage for all.

However, a number of cases from other jurisdictions have concluded that if the policy contains language stating the severability of the insurer's obligation, exclusionary clauses apply separately to each insured, <i>even when language internal to the clauses themselves might suggest otherwise.</i> Thus, these cases reason, an exclusion must be considered solely from the standpoint of the <i>insured seeking coverage,</i> so that facts which would preclude coverage of a particular insured do not necessarily preclude coverage for the related liability of another.</p>\n<p>In <i>Worcester Mut.

The policy excluded coverage for liability arising from the operation or ownership of a motor vehicle by \"any\" insured, but also contained a severability clause. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 159.) After consuming alcohol at a party in the family residence, the son drove friends home in his car. En route, he struck and killed a pedestrian. The parents were sued, on a theory of negligent supervision, for allowing the son to drive while drunk. Citing the motor vehicle exclusion, the insurer declined the parents' tender of defense. In a coverage action, the trial court, found that a defense was required.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.

Because the insured parents neither owned nor operated the accident vehicle, the court reasoned, the exclusionary clause could not bar their claim for coverage. (<i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Shamban v.

In <i>West American Ins. Co. v. AV &amp; S</i> (10th Cir.1998) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754807\"><a href=\"/opinion/754807/west-american-insurance-company-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-av/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1224</span></a></span>, a business liability policy covered several pizza franchisees and their employees. The policy excluded coverage for liability arising from ownership or operation of a motor vehicle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*857</span> by \"any\" insured. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1226.) In light of the policy's severability clause, the court concluded, the exclusion applied only to the particular franchisee whose coinsured employee caused an accident while delivering pizza in his own car. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1229.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Fournelle <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Est,</span> supra</span>,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2189225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2189225/american-nat-fire-ins-v-fournelle-est/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, a homeowners policy named the husband and wife as insureds and defined, as additional insureds, relatives and dependent minors who were \"residents of <i>your</i> household.\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 293, italics added.) The policy, which contained a severability clause, generally covered an insured's liability for bodily injury to another, but excluded such coverage for injury to \"you\" (i.e., a named insured) or \"any\" resident-of-household insured. (<i>Ibid.</i>) After moving from the family home pending a divorce, the husband returned for a visit, killed his children, and then committed suicide. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that despite the exclusionary clause, the policy covered the father's estate for the children's wrongful deaths.</p>\n<p>The court reasoned as follows: \"[Severability demands that policy exclusions be construed only with reference to the particular insured seeking coverage. [Citations].\" (<i>Fournelle <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273071\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273071/jacobson-v-simmons-real-estate/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Estate,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2189225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2189225/american-nat-fire-ins-v-fournelle-est/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 294.) Hence, the issue was whether, with respect to <i>husband individually,</i> the children were additional insureds for whose deaths <i>he</i> was not covered. Because, at the time of their deaths, the children were no longer residents of <i>his</i> household, they were not additional insureds <i>as to him.</i> Accordingly, <i>he</i> and his estate were not denied coverage by virtue of the exclusionary clause.

The court reasoned that the meaning of \"an\" was ambiguous in light of the policy's severability clause, which specified that coverage applied separately to each insured. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 37.)

In related coverage actions, the insurers argued whether their policies covered the judgment. One policy excluded coverage for liability arising from the ownership or use of an inboard-powered watercraft `\"owned by any insured.'\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1690, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The scope of this exclusion became an issue on appeal in the coverage litigation.</p>\n<p>After finding the boat itself came within the exclusionary clause, the Court of Appeal addressed Yessian's claim that the exclusion applied only to the insured <i>husband</i> and not to his coinsured wife. The theory asserted was that the stipulated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*859</span> judgment against the wife was based not on her personal ownership or operation of the boat, but solely on community property laws making her vicariously liable for her husband's torts.</p>\n<p>At the outset, the Court of Appeal saw no indication that the wife's liability was vicarious only. As the court noted, the tort complaints against the couple alleged their joint ownership, possession, control, and operation of the jet boat at the time of the accident.

(<i>California <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Casualty,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Acknowledging the split among other jurisdictions, the court found \"more persuasive\" the cases concluding that \"a clause excluding [coverage] for specific conduct should prevail over a more general severability provision.\" (<i>California <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Casualty,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span>.) \"Indeed,\" the court observed, \"acceptance of Yessian's position would effectively nullify exclusions from coverage in any case involving married coinsureds and a policy with a severability provision. . . . It is inconceivable that parties to a policy would include clauses specifically excluding coverage for claims based on certain types of conduct, but intend those exclusions to have no effect in any case involving claims against coinsured spouses.\" (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 1697-1698, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>The severability discussion in <i>California Casualty</i> is arguably dictum, since the Court of Appeal appeared to believe the exclusion applied directly to the wife by virtue of her personal conduct. Moreover, it is unclear the extent to which the court's narrow construction of the severability provision stemmed from its particular concern that exclusionary clauses might be nullified in actions against the community for the torts of a single spouse.</p>\n<p>Such concerns are not present here. Any liability of Kelly's parents for Christopher's death is not merely vicarious or derivative. Instead, their liability is premised on the <i>independent</i> theory that they negligently failed to supervise and control Kelly's access to the firearm with which Christopher was shot.</p>\n<p>Under the instant circumstances at least, I am persuaded by the cases concluding that when a multiparty liability insurance policy contains a severability provision, the effect is to extend both the policy's coverage, and its exclusions, <i>individually</i> to <i>each</i> insured, as if he or she were the <i>only</i> insured, subject to policy limits. Under this rule, exclusions from coverage are <i>personal</i> and may not be imputed from one insured to another, even where, as here, language internal to an exclusionary clause, viewed in isolation, could be read to withdraw coverage from all insureds for the excludable conduct of one.</p>\n<p>These conclusions follow from established California principles governing the construction of insurance contracts. Insurance policies, like all contracts, apply according to their plain terms but must be interpreted when ambiguous. Whether policy language is clear or ambiguous is determined in context, not by viewing words or phrases in isolation. (<i>Bank of the West v. Superior Court</i> (1992) 2 Cal.4th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*860</span> 1254, 1265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Safeco identifies no meaning for this provision other than the one apparent from its words, i.e., that each of multiple insureds under the policy was to be treated, within policy limits, as though the policy applied <i>only</i> to him or her. This promise of severable interests would be rendered meaningless if the single word \"an\" in the exclusionary clause were nonetheless found to prevail, and to make the exclusion collective. (Cf. <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">AIU,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 827, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

It is unlikely Kelly's parents understood that by <i>extending</i> their homeowners' coverage to include Kelly as an additional insured, they were actually <i>narrowing their own coverage</i> for claims arising from his torts. In light of the severability provision, Safeco's intent to achieve that result was not clearly expressed, and the ambiguity must be resolved in the insureds' favor.</p>\n<p>Applying these principles to the facts of the instant case, I conclude that the illegal act exclusion in Safeco's policy does <i>not</i> withdraw coverage from Kelly's parents for liability arising from their alleged negligence in allowing Kelly to shoot Christopher. As to Kelly's parents, I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and would instruct that court to remand with directions to enter summary judgment for the insureds.</p>\n<p>BROWN, J., concurs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The concurring and dissenting opinion is mistaken in its reliance on <i>20th Century Ins.

That case involved a criminal act exclusion (63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>), a policy provision that is <i>not</i> before us in this case. In addition, the death in <i>20th Century</i> occurred after the insured placed one bullet in a revolver and pulled the trigger three times. The third time the insured pulled the trigger he was pointing the gun at the victim; it fired and killed the victim. The Court of Appeal, after noting that the case did not involve negligence, mistake, or inadvertence, concluded that the insured's conduct \"could be considered to have been committed with implied malice and therefore have constituted second degree murder.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252550/20th-century-ins-co-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>.) Here, there is no evidence that Kelly S. acted with implied malice when, after taking steps that he believed would <i>unload</i> the gun, he <i>accidentally</i> shot and killed Christopher Mitchell.</p>\n<p>[2]  The concurring and dissenting opinion discusses at length the effect of the \"Severability of Insurance\" clause in the policy on the illegal act exclusionary clause. (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Baxter, J., <i>post,</i> 110 Cal.Rptr.2d at pp. 856-860, 28 P.3d at pp. 899-902.) It acknowledges, however, that there is a significant division of authority among the courts that have addressed this question. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 856-858 &amp; fn. 3, 28 P.3d at pp. 899-901 &amp; fn. 3.) Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to address this additional issue, a matter that plaintiffs did not raise or address in their briefs to this court and that Safeco only alluded to in its answering brief and discussed in abbreviated form in its response to one of the amicus curiae briefs.</p>\n<p>[1]  Under the facts of this case, there can be no ambiguity about whether the policy excluded acts which, though technically forbidden or unathorized by law, resulted in mere accidental death or injury. In the first place, the only injuries the policy purported to cover at all were those arising from \"accident[s];\" hence, the policy's <i>exclusions,</i> such as that for an insured's illegal act, would be superfluous unless applied to injuries which might be considered accidental. Moreover, the policy also contained express exclusions for injuries which were (1) \"expected or intended\" by an insured or (2) \"the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended\" by an insured, thus suggesting that an intentional act or injury was not a prerequisite to the distinct illegal act exclusion. Finally, application of the exclusion here does not arise simply because an act the law happens to forbid produced an accidental injury. As discussed above, the illegal act one commits when he points a firearm at a human being and deliberately pulls the trigger, causing the weapon to discharge and kill, is far beyond mere inadvertence or commonplace negligence.</p>\n<p>[2]  The <i>Nemetz</i> court agreed that public policy might bar coverage for wife if her tacit involvement in husband's arson plan rendered her less than \"innocent.\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1593432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1593432/northwestern-nat-ins-co-v-nemetz/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nemetz,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1593432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1593432/northwestern-nat-ins-co-v-nemetz/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1593432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1593432/northwestern-nat-ins-co-v-nemetz/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38.)

We conclude that, in the context of the policy as a whole, the insurer does have such an obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">On March 10, 1995, 16-year-old Kelly S. and some of his friends were at Kelly\u2019s home when Kelly found a .22-caliber Beretta handgun in his mother\u2019s coat pocket. Kelly\u2019s father had taught him how to handle a 9-millimeter Beretta. Taking the same precautions he would have taken to unload a 9-millimeter Beretta, Kelly removed the clip from the handle of the .22-caliber Beretta, placed the clip on a table, and pulled back the slide on the gun. Believing the gun to be unloaded, Kelly pulled the trigger. The gun fired, killing his friend, Christopher Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">A petition alleging Kelly\u2019s commission of involuntary manslaughter, a felony (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)), was filed in juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602). The court sustained the petition, made Kelly a ward of the court, and placed him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Timothy and Christy Mitchell, the parents of Christopher, brought a wrongful death action against Kelly and his parents, who tendered defense of the action to Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco) under their homeowners insurance policy. Safeco undertook the defense under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Safeco then brought this action in superior court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify its insureds because the policy excluded coverage for an \u201cillegal act.\u201d Named as defendants were the insureds and the Mitchells. Safeco unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment, contending that the accidental killing of Christopher fell within the policy exclusion for an \u201cillegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Thereafter Christy Mitchell, joined by the insureds, moved for summary judgment contending that Safeco as a matter of law had a duty to defend and indemnify. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the policy\u2019s \u201cillegal act\u201d exclusion could reasonably be interpreted as excluding coverage only for an <em>intentional </em>illegal act. The court found it was \u201cundisputed that Kelly S[.] did not intend to cause harm to Mitchell\u2019s son [and] that [Kelly] did not intend to commit an unlawful or \u2018illegal\u2019 act.\u201d Accordingly, the court ruled that the Mitchells\u2019 wrongful death claim was potentially covered by the insureds\u2019 policy, giving rise to Safeco\u2019s duty to defend. Safeco appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Relying on a dictionary definition of \u201cillegal\u201d as meaning \u201cnot according to or authorized by law; unlawful,\u201d the Court of Appeal concluded that the illegal act exclusion in the policy precluded coverage for any act in violation of civil or criminal law, whether or not the person committing the act intended to cause harm or to violate the law, but that it did not exclude coverage for ordinary civil negligence. Applying this understanding of the scope of the policy\u2019s illegal act exclusion, the court held that the policy did not provide coverage for an act causing death that resulted in a juvenile court adjudication of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We granted the separate petitions for review filed by the insureds and Christy Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The homeowners policy at issue here covered the period June 30, 1994, through June 30, 1995. The accidental shooting occurred in March 1995. Under the terms of the policy, Kelly and his parents are insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Relevant here are these policy provisions: Safeco agreed to defend and indemnify the insureds in the event of claims brought against any insured for bodily injury caused by \u201can occurrence,\u201d which the policy defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury during the policy period. Excluded from coverage was liability for bodily injury \u201carising out of any <em>illegal act </em>committed by or at the direction of an insured.\u201d (Italics added.) The policy did not define the term \u201cillegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">We now turn to the task of stating the controlling principles of insurance contract interpretation and applying them to the policy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Insurance policies are contracts and therefore subject to the rules of construction governing contracts. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) The goal of contractual interpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636; <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 867 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">A policy provision is ambiguous when it can have two or more reasonable constructions. <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) An ambiguity \u201c\u2018is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation. [Citation.] If application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity, ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty\" to exist. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018This rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, \u201cthe objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 645, 667 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878].) \u201cAny ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>(Kazi v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 871, 879 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 15 P.3d 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The homeowners policy here excluded coverage \u201carising out of any <em>illegal </em>act committed by or at the direction of an insured.\u201d (Italics added.) The phrase \u201cillegal act\u201d is susceptible of two reasonable meanings. As mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal, relying on a dictionary definition, construed the term broadly, as meaning any act prohibited by law. But the term can also be interpreted more narrowly as meaning a violation of criminal law. This is the construction Safeco urges us to adopt. Certain thesauruses do treat the term \u201cillegal\u201d as synonymous with \u201ccriminal.\u201d (See, e.g., Burton, Legal Thesaurus (1980) p. 257 [stating that \u201cagainst the law\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d are synonyms of \u201cillegal\u201d]; Webster\u2019s Collegiate Thesaurus (1976) p. 414 [stating that \u201ccriminal\u201d is a synonym of \u201cillegal\u201d].) If we were to adopt this meaning in the context of the policy here, we would have to treat the policy\u2019s clause excluding coverage for an \u201cillegal act\u201d as the equivalent of a clause excluding coverage for a \u201ccriminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The policy before us, however, contains not a <em>criminal act </em>exclusion but an <em>illegal act </em>exclusion. Had Safeco wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage, it could have easily done so. Insurers commonly insert an exclusion for criminal acts in their liability policies.

Because Safeco chose not to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>a criminal act exclusion, instead opting for an illegal act exclusion, we cannot read into the policy what Safeco has omitted. To do so would violate the fundamental principle that in interpreting contracts, including insurance contracts, courts are not to insert what has been omitted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <em>Jensen v. Traders &amp; General Ins. Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 786, 790 [345 P.2d 1]; <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Simmons Real Estate </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1294 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 699].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We now consider the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction of the term \u201cillegal\u201d as meaning violation of <em>any </em>law, whether civil or criminal. (See, e.g., Webster\u2019s 9th New Collegiate Dict. (1989) p. 599 [\u201cnot according to or authorized by law; unlawful\u201d]; Webster\u2019s New World Dict. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 699 [\u201cprohibited by law; against the law; unlawful; illicit; also, not authorized or sanctioned, as by rules\u201d]; Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1979) p. 673, col. 2 [\u201cagainst or not authorized by law\u201d]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 160 [\u201c \u2018Law\u2019 includes constitutional, statutory, and decisional law\u201d].) That construction, however, is so broad as to render the policy\u2019s liability coverage practically meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">For instance, a violation of \u201cany law\u201d would include the law governing negligence, which holds individuals responsible for the failure to exercise ordinary care resulting in injury to another. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714 [\u201cEvery one is responsible ... for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill . . . .\u201d].) The duty to exercise ordinary care is imposed by law. (See <em>Sharon P. </em>v. <em>Arman, Ltd. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1181, 1188-1889 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 35, 989 P.2d 121].) A violation of that duty is therefore <em>a violation of law. </em>Broadly construed, a violation of <em>any </em>law, whether civil or criminal, is an illegal act. An insured\u2019s negligent act, being a violation of law and therefore <em>an illegal act, </em>would thus not be covered under Safeco\u2019s policy excluding coverage for an insured\u2019s illegal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">But the homeowners policy that the insureds here bought from Safeco expressly provided that Safeco would defend and indemnify them for bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>injury caused by \u201can occurrence,\u201d which the policy defines as \u201can accident . . . which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d Because the term \u201caccident\u201d is more comprehensive than the term \u201cnegligence\u201d and thus includes negligence (Black\u2019s Law Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 14, col. 2), Safeco\u2019s homeowners policy promised coverage for liability resulting from the insured\u2019s negligent acts. That promise would be rendered illusory if, as discussed above, we were to construe the phrase \u201cillegal act,\u201d as contained in the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause, to mean violation of any law, whether criminal or civil.  When reasonably practical, contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect, and that is consistent with the parties\u2019 intent. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1643; see <em>Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1115 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The Court of Appeal attempted to give the policy a practical and workable construction by drawing a distinction between negligence involving the failure to exercise ordinary care, which the court viewed as falling outside the illegal act exclusion, and gross negligence involving a punishable public offense, which the court considered to be within the policy\u2019s exclusion. After stating that the exclusion was not limited to liability arising out of a criminal conviction or criminal act, the Court of Appeal stated that \u201cwhile the failure to exercise ordinary care may result in the imposition of an obligation to provide compensation for any loss caused by one\u2019s negligence, such failure to exercise ordinary care is not \u2018illegal.\u2019 \u201d It then concluded that the \u201cspecific act at issue in the present case, involuntary manslaughter, falls into an entirely different category, involving as it did gross negligence and the commission of a punishable, public offense.\u201d We disagree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">It is not clear how the Court of Appeal defined the word \u201cillegal\u201d as it is used in the exclusionary clause. If the Court of Appeal construed the exclusionary clause as excluding every offense, that is, every crime, it defines the word \u201cillegal\u201d as meaning \u201ccriminal.\u201d As we have seen, that definition is inappropriate here because it rewrites the policy by inserting what has been omitted. Drawing a distinction, as the Court of Appeal did, between negligent acts and grossly negligent acts exceeds the bounds of construction by rewriting the policy. The word \u201cillegal\u201d is not a synonym for \u201cgross negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">As we noted earlier, \u201cambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>(Kazi v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 879.) An insured should not be expected to know the subtle legal distinctions between the concepts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ordinary negligence and gross negligence. Such distinctions are not objectively within the reasonable expectations of the insured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Also, to draw a distinction between negligent and grossly negligent acts, as the Court of Appeal did, would be at odds with Insurance Code section 533. Under that provision, an \u201cinsurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured; but he is not exonerated by the <em>negligence </em>of the insured . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The statute does not distinguish between ordinary and gross negligence.  Therefore, an insurer intending to exclude from a homeowner\u2019s policy coverage for gross negligence would have to say so in express terms, instead of, as here, using the ambiguous phrase \u201cillegal act.\u201d The \u201c \u2018burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.\u2019 \u201d <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Jacober </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 193, 202 [110 Cal.Rptr. 1, 514 P.2d 953].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Safeco would have us give effect to the policy\u2019s illegal act exclusion in this case, despite the absence of any satisfactory definition <em>of </em>the word \u201cillegal,\u201d because any insured would reasonably expect that an accidentally caused death resulting in a conviction for involuntary manslaughter would fall within the policy\u2019s \u201cillegal act\u201d exclusion. Safeco\u2019s view leaves the exclusionary clause without meaning until after an event has occurred. This violates the rule that expectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1649; <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Admiral Ins. Co., supra, 10 </em>Cal.4th at p. 666.) Moreover, an insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations are measured not by an insured\u2019s knowledge of the nuances of criminal law, but by what an insured would expect to be covered by the policy. The proper inquiry is: Would reasonable insureds expect their homeowners policy to protect them against liability for accidental injury or death occurring in their home? The answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In short, because the illegal act exclusion cannot reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract, it must be rejected as invalid. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Finally, we reject Safeco\u2019s contention that Civil Code section 1668 relieves it of any duty to indemnify the insureds for liability resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Kelly\u2019s accidental killing of Christopher Mitchell. Section 1668 provides: \u201cAll contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\u201d Section 1668 applies to contractual exemptions from liability, not to indemnity contracts. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Eddy </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 958, 967 [267 Cal.Rptr. 379]; <em>Lemat Corp. v. American Basketball Assn. </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 267, 278-279 [124 Cal.Rptr. 388].) An insurance policy is an indemnity contract. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 22.) Thus, section 1668 simply does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">For the reasons given above, we conclude that the Mitchells\u2019 wrongful death action is within the liability coverage of the homeowners policy at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed with directions to enter judgment affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">George, C. J., Werdegar, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> The concurring and dissenting opinion is mistaken in its reliance on <em>20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1333 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 492]. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Baxter, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 768-769.) That case involved a criminal act exclusion (63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336), a policy provision that is <em>not </em>before us in this case. In addition, the death in <em>20th Century </em>occurred after the insured placed one bullet in a revolver and pulled the trigger three times. The third time the insured pulled the trigger he was pointing the gun at the victim; it fired and killed the victim. The Court of Appeal, after noting that the case did not involve negligence, mistake, or inadvertence, concluded that the insured\u2019s conduct \u201ccould be considered to have been committed with implied malice and therefore have constituted second degree murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1339.) Here, there is no evidence that Kelly S. acted with implied malice when, after taking steps that he believed would <em>unload </em>the gun, he <em>accidentally </em>shot and killed Christopher Mitchell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> The concurring and dissenting opinion discusses at length the effect of the \u201cSeverability of Insurance\u201d clause in the policy on the illegal act exclusionary clause. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Baxter, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 772-777.) It acknowledges, however, that there is a significant division of authority among the courts that have addressed this question. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 772-775 &amp; fn. 3.) Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to address this additional issue, a matter that plaintiffs did not raise or address in their briefs to this court and that Safeco only alluded to in its answering brief and discussed in abbreviated form in its response to one of the amicus curiae briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>",

I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s determination that, despite the policy\u2019s explicit refusal to cover an insured for his or her \u201cillegal act,\u201d the policy nonetheless covered <em>Kelly himself </em>for his criminal homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">On the latter point, I accept, for purposes of argument, that an \u201cillegal act\u201d could mean something <em>broader </em>than a \u201ccriminal act,\u201d a more common form of coverage exclusion. There may be situations that would strain the outer limits of an illegal act exclusion in a policy designed to afford coverage for accidental injuries. Finally, I do not doubt that all reasonable uncertainty about the phrase\u2019s meaning must be resolved against the insurer, which drafted the policy, and in favor of coverage a policyholder would reasonably expect. Hence, I am satisfied that the illegal act exclusion cannot contravene the parties\u2019 basic understanding that coverage would be afforded for an insured\u2019s ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">But Kelly cannot benefit from even the <em>narrowest </em>reasonable interpretation of the illegal act exclusion. An exclusion for illegal acts must apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>wherever a criminal act exclusion would apply; \u00e1ny criminal act is also illegal, and no layperson would understand otherwise. Moreover, even if the meaning of \u201cillegal\u201d might be uncertain when applied to particular facts, it cannot be so here. An illegal act exclusion must at least have been intended, and understood, to withdraw liability coverage from an insured who, by recklessly pointing and shooting a loaded firearm, committed the grave felony offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Such a conclusion does not undermine the purposes of an insurance policy intended to afford liability coverage for accidental injuries. Nor does it defeat the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage. A policyholder found guilty of criminal homicide under such circumstances could hardly expect that his or her tort liability for the killing somehow falls outside an explicit exclusion for \u201cillegal acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The majority discount a recent Court of Appeal decision, <em>20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1333 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 492] <em>(20th Century), </em>that illustrates this point. There, during a party, 19-year-old Matthew Guglietti, while intoxicated, took a revolver from his parents\u2019 bedroom and inserted one bullet. He pointed the gun at a friend and pulled the trigger, then pointed the gun at his own head and pulled the trigger again. The next day, as the party continued, Guglietti, still intoxicated, retrieved the revolver. He pointed the gun at victim DiGeronimo and pulled the trigger once more. The weapon discharged, wounding DiGeronimo fatally. To avoid murder charges, Guglietti pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter with personal use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Edwina Stewart, DiGeronimo\u2019s mother, sued Guglietti for wrongful death. Guglietti, an insured under his parents\u2019 homeowners policy, tendered his defense to the insurer. The policy excluded coverage for injury foreseeably resulting from an insured\u2019s \u201ccriminal act.\u201d <em>(20th Century, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336.) The insurer accepted the defense under a reservation of rights but sued Stewart, Guglietti, and Guglietti\u2019s parents to determine coverage. Thereafter, the insurer won a declaratory judgment that no coverage was afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. As the court explained, \u201cStewart contends the [pjolicy\u2019s criminal act exclusion is ambiguous\u201d <em>(20th Century, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337) and \u201chas proffered several factual circumstances which, if applicable, arguably would subject the [pjolicy\u2019s criminal act exclusion to several reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1338.) \u201cHowever,\u201d the court emphasized, \u201cshe does not suggest alternative reasonable interpretations <em>under the facts of this case.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) As the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>noted, Guglietti\u2019s action had resulted in his conviction of a serious felony, eliminating any doubt whether the conduct at issue came within the meaning of \u201ccriminal act\u201d as used in the policy. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Moreover, the court' observed, even if the exclusion might be deemed ambiguous, there could be \u201cno reasonable expectation that the [pjolicy covered liability for Guglietti\u2019s killing of DiGeronimo. Stewart posits that the criminal act of . . . manslaughter is based on and really nothing more than negligence and that an insured would reasonably expect the [pjolicy would cover injury caused by an insured\u2019s negligence. [&lt;[[] [But] Stewart\u2019s characterization of Guglietti\u2019s action as . . . based or premised on [mere] negligence trivializes his conduct. This is not a case in which a [firearm] was negligently mishandled and fired by mistake or inadvertence. Guglietti deliberately and intentionally pointed the revolver at DiGeronimo and deliberately and intentionally pulled the trigger. . . . HQ Under these circumstances we conclude the insured could not reasonably have expected the [p]olicy\u2019s coverage for injury caused by negligence to have covered Guglietti\u2019s criminal act.\u201d <em>(20th Century, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338-1339, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Here, as in <em>20th Century, </em>there can be no claim that the phrase \u201cillegal act\u201d is ambiguous <em>as applied to this case. </em>Kelly\u2019s fatal shooting of Christopher Mitchell comes within any reasonable understanding of the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause. In a juvenile proceeding instituted for that purpose, it was found beyond reasonable doubt that Kelly\u2019s act constituted the serious felony offense of manslaughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 192, 193.) As noted above, when the killing of another is adjudged a serious violation of the <em>penal law, </em>an ordinary layperson would certainly understand the conduct to be <em>illegal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">For similar reasons, Kelly had no reasonable expectation that, despite the exclusion for \u201cillegal act[s],\u201d he was covered for his criminal homicide. Urging the contrary, defendants suggest the tragedy was simply a negligent accident, in that Kelly tried to unload the weapon, thought he had disabled it, and intended no harm. But, as in <em>20th Century, </em>this characterization trivializes the seriousness of the unlawful conduct at issue. Here, as there, the victim was not killed by the mere negligent mishandling of a gun that caused it to fire inadvertently. Instead, it is undisputed that Kelly brandished the gun, pointed it in the general direction of Christopher\u2019s head, and deliberately pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Even if Kelly thought the weapon was unloaded and intended no injury, he committed a wilful and potentially lethal act without \u201cdue caution and circumspection\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)). Because of the obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>danger, it is universal knowledge that one must never engage the firing mechanism of a gun while aiming it anywhere near another human being. Laypersons also know it is a serious crime to injure or kill another by the reckless mishandling of a firearm. In the face of an exclusion for illegal acts, Kelly\u2019s expectation that the policy covered his ordinary negligence could not include the reasonable belief that he would be covered for his reckless shooting of Christopher, which led to an adjudication he was guilty of the felony of manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The majority decline to accept this logic, and therefore to find the exclusion applicable to Kelly. Instead, they conclude that because the illegal act exclusion might be difficult to apply in <em>some </em>factual situations, it is simply null and void in <em>every </em>case, including one where its application is beyond debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The majority offer meager support for this sweeping conclusion. They suggest that to apply the exclusionary clause to these facts, when its meaning \u25a0might be uncertain in other cases, would violate the rule that \u201cexpectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1636, 1649; <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co. </em>[(1995)] 10 Cal.4th [645,] 666 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878].)\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 766.) Not so. As indicated above, from the inception of the contract, an insured could only have expected that the illegal act exclusion would bar coverage for his or her criminally reckless homicide resulting in a conviction for manslaughter. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, a lay policyholder was not required to appreciate \u201csubtle legal distinctions\u201d to reach that understanding. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The majority posit that \u201cbecause the illegal act exclusion cannot reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract, it must be rejected as invalid. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1653.)\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 766.) The cited statute\u2014the only authority the majority provide for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>proposition\u2014states the unremarkable maxim that \u201c[wjords in a contract which are wholly inconsistent with its nature, or with the main intention of the parties, are to be rejected.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1653.) The majority fail to show how interpreting the illegal act exclusion to bar coverage for the felony of manslaughter, committed by the wilful and reckless misuse of a deadly weapon, would give the clause a meaning \u201cwholly inconsistent\u201d with the nature of the contract or the \u201cmain intention of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In another context, the majority insist that courts cannot insert in an insurance contract what the parties have omitted. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 764, 765.) But by <em>omitting </em>what was <em>expressly inserted and agreed upon, </em>the majority do equal damage to the parties\u2019 intent and expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Accordingly, I cannot join the majority\u2019s strained effort to avoid applying the exclusionary clause to Kelly\u2019s commission of manslaughter. With respect to coverage for Kelly personally, I would affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that judgment should be entered for Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">I reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to any liability of Kelly\u2019s <em>parents </em>for the fatal shooting. They committed no reckless homicide and were found guilty of no crime. The causes of action against them for Christopher\u2019s wrongful death relied solely on allegations of their negligent supervision, control, and maintenance of Kelly\u2014in other words, the alleged breach of their duty of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">As indicated above, the illegal act exclusion could not apply <em>directly </em>to the mere negligent acts or omissions of Kelly\u2019s parents. Such a broad interpretation of \u201cillegal\u201d would defeat the reasonable expectation that a policy promising to pay bodily injury damages \u201cfor which the insured is <em>legally </em>liable\u201d (italics added) at least covers liability for an accidental injury arising from his or her ordinary negligence. Safeco does not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">However, Safeco urges that the particular language of the exclusionary clause withdraws coverage from Kelly\u2019s parents for any claim based on <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>illegal act. As Safeco notes, the clause states that the policy\u2019s coverage is inapplicable to liability \u201carising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of <em>an </em>insured.\u201d (Italics added.) Safeco insists that the reference to \u201can\u201d insured bars <em>all </em>policyholders from coverage for liability related to the illegal act of any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">It is true that in policies with multiple insureds, the cases have distinguished clauses that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to \u201cthe\u201d insured from those that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>\u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insured. Absent contrary evidence, the former language is considered singular and specific, so that one insured remains covered despite facts that exclude coverage for another, while the latter is considered plural and indefinite, so that if particular facts exclude coverage for one or more insureds, they exclude coverage for all. (E.g., <em>California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau v. Warwick </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 190, 194-195 [130 Cal.Rptr.520, 550 P.2d 1056] (Warwick); <em>Fire Ins. Exchange v. Altieri </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1360-1361 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 360] <em>(Altieri).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">However, Safeco\u2019s policy also contained a paragraph entitled \u201cSeverability of Insurance.\u201d In language common to many insurance contracts, this paragraph stated that, subject to the policy\u2019s monetary limits, \u201c[t]his insurance applies <em>separately to each insured.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u201cSeverability is a widely recognized doctrine that acknowledges the separate and distinct obligations the insurer undertakes to the various insureds, named and unnamed. [Citations.] The intent of a severability clause is to provide each insured with separate coverage, as if each were separately insured with a distinct policy, subject to the liability limits of the policy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(American Nat. Fire Ins. Co. v. Fournelle Est. </em>(Minn. 1991) 472 N.W.2d 292, 294 <em>(Fournelle Est.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Little California authority considers the effect of severability clauses on exclusionary provisions. However, a number of cases from other jurisdictions have concluded that if the policy contains language stating the sever-ability of the insurer\u2019s obligation, exclusionary clauses apply separately to each insured, <em>even when language internal to the clauses themselves might suggest otherwise. </em>Thus, these cases reason, an exclusion must be considered solely from the standpoint of the <em>insured seeking coverage, </em>so that facts which would preclude coverage of a particular insured do not necessarily preclude coverage for the related liability of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell </em>(1986) 398 Mass. 240 [496 N.E.2d 158] <em>(Marnell), </em>parents\u2019 homeowners policy included their son as an insured. The policy excluded coverage for liability arising from the operation or ownership of a motor vehicle by \u201cany\u201d insured, but also contained a sever-ability clause. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 159.) After consuming alcohol at a party in the family residence, the son drove friends home in his car. En route, he struck and tilled a pedestrian. The parents were sued, on a theory of negligent supervision, for allowing the son to drive while drunk. Citing the motor vehicle exclusion, the insurer declined the parents\u2019 tender of defense. In a coverage action, the trial court found that a defense was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed. The court conceded that, absent a severability clause, the exclusionary reference to \u201cany\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>insured would bar coverage for the parents\u2019 liability arising from their coinsured son\u2019s ownership and operation of the car. <em>(Marnell, supra, </em>496 N.E.2d 158, 160-161.) However, the court explained, a severability provision \u201crequires that each insured be treated as having a separate insurance policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">\u201cThus,\u201d the court observed, \u201cthe term \u2018insured\u2019 as used in the motor vehicle exclusion refers <em>only to the person claiming </em>[liability] <em>coverage under the </em>policy.\u201d <em>(Marnell, supra, </em>496 N.E.2d 158, 161, italics added.) Because the insured parents neither owned nor operated the accident vehicle, the court reasoned, the exclusionary clause could not bar their claim for coverage. (I<em>bid.; </em>see also <em>Shamban v. Worcester Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 47 Mass.App. 10 [710 N.E.2d 627, 630] [in homeowners policy with severability clause, policy exclusion for operation of motor vehicle by \u201can\u201d insured did not bar coverage of parents sued for negligent supervision of coinsured son, who caused injury while riding his dirt bike].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Applying Utah law, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently took the same view of a motor vehicle exclusion in a policy containing severability language. In <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>AV &amp; S </em>(10th Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 1224, a business liability policy covered several pizza franchisees and their employees. The policy excluded coverage for liability arising from ownership or operation of a motor vehicle by \u201cany\u201d insured. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1226.) In light of the policy\u2019s severability clause, the court concluded, the exclusion applied only to the particular franchisee whose coinsured employee caused an accident while delivering pizza in his own car. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Fournelle Est., supra, </em>472 N.W.2d 292, a homeowners policy named the husband and wife as insureds and defined, as additional insureds, relatives and dependent minors who were \u201cresidents of <em>your </em>household.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 293, italics added.) The policy, which contained a severability clause, generally covered an insured\u2019s liability for bodily injury to another, but excluded such coverage for injury to \u201cyou\u201d (i.e., a named insured) or \u201cany\u201d resident-of-household insured. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After moving from the family home pending a divorce, the husband returned for a visit, killed his children, and then committed suicide. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that despite the exclusionary clause, the policy covered the father\u2019s estate for the children\u2019s wrongful deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The court reasoned as follows: \u201c[S]everability demands that policy exclusions be construed only with reference to the particular insured seeking coverage. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Fournelle Est., supra, </em>472 N.W.2d 292, 294.) Hence, the issue was whether, with respect to the <em>husband individually, </em>the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>were additional insureds for whose deaths <em>he </em>was not covered. Because, at the time of their deaths, the children were no longer residents of <em>his </em>household, they were not additional insureds <em>as to him. </em>Accordingly, <em>he </em>and his estate were not denied coverage by virtue of the exclusionary clause. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Keegan </em>(5th Cir. 2000) 209 F.3d 767, 768-770 [under Texas law, where husband-wife homeowners policy with severability clause defined additional insured to include \u201cmember of your household\u201d and excluded bodily injury coverage for \u201can\u201d insured, husband, who had moved from marital household, was covered for negligent injury to child who remained with wife as household resident].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In <em>Brumley v. Lee </em>(1998) 265 Kan. 810 [963 P.2d 1224], the Kansas Supreme Court concluded that because a severability provision gives each insured separate coverage, a homeowners policy clause which \u201cambiguous [ly]\u201d excluded liability coverage for intentional acts by \u201cany\u201d insured did not bar coverage for an insured husband, sued on grounds he <em>negligently </em>failed to prevent his coinsured wife from inflicting an intentional, and fatal, blow upon a child. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1227-1228; see also <em>Catholic Diocese of Dodge City </em>v. <em>Raymer </em>(1992) 251 Kan. 689 [840 P.2d 456, 459-462] [in homeowners policy with severability clause, exclusion for intentional conduct, or damage expected or intended, by \u201can\u201d insured did not bar coverage of parents, sued for negligent supervision in connection with coinsured son\u2019s vandalism of school property].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">To like effect are <em>Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. v. Nemetz </em>(1986) 135 Wis.2d 245 [400 N.W.2d 33] <em>(Nemetz) </em>and <em>Premier Ins. Co. v. Adams </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1994) 632 So.2d 1054. In <em>Nemetz, </em>a liability policy excluded coverage for damage expected or intended by \u201can\u201d insured. <em>(Nemetz, supra, </em>at p. 37, fn. 2.) The court reasoned that the meaning of \u201can\u201d was ambiguous in light of the policy\u2019s severability clause, which specified that coverage applied separately to each insured. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 37.) Resolving the ambiguity in favor of coverage, the court held that an insured wife was covered for a suit alleging her negligence in failing to prevent her coinsured husband from \u201ctorching\u201d the couple\u2019s bar. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 37-38.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Adams </em>reached a similar result under a homeowners policy that excluded injury expected or intended by \u201cany\u201d insured, but also contained a severability provision. <em>(Adams, supra, </em>at pp. 1055-1056.) The court held that because a severability clause promises each insured separate coverage, parents were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>covered in a suit claiming that their negligent supervision allowed their child to commit an act of sexual abuse. <em>(Id.., </em>at pp. 1056-1057.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Only one California decision has addressed the effect of severability language upon an exclusionary clause. In <em>California Casualty Ins. Co. v. Northland Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1682 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 434] <em>(California Casualty), </em>a husband and wife, insureds under multiple liability policies, stipulated to a judgment in favor of one Yessian, who had been injured in a collision with their jet boat. In related coverage actions, the insurers argued whether their policies covered the judgment. One policy excluded coverage for liability arising from the ownership or use of an inboard-powered watercraft \u201c \u2018owned by any insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1690.) The scope of this exclusion became an issue on appeal in the coverage litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">After finding the boat itself came within the exclusionary clause, the Court of Appeal addressed Yessian\u2019s claim that the exclusion applied only to the insured <em>husband </em>and not to his coinsured wife. The theory asserted was that the stipulated judgment against the wife was based not on her personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>ownership or operation of the boat, but solely on community property laws making her vicariously liable for her husband\u2019s torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">At the outset, the Court of Appeal saw no indication that the wife\u2019s liability was vicarious only. As the court noted, the tort complaints against the couple alleged their joint ownership, possession, control, and operation of the jet boat at the time of the accident. <em>(California Casualty, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 1682, 1695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In any event, the court held, the wife was not covered even if the judgment against her was based solely on her community property interest. The court applied the California rule that when an exclusion bars coverage for defined conduct by \u201can\u201d insured, the exclusion extends to the related liability of any other insureds, even if that liability is merely derivative or vicarious. <em>(California Casualty, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 1682, 1696; see text discussion, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Nor, the court concluded, did the policy\u2019s severability language alter this result. Acknowledging the split among other jurisdictions, the court found \u201cmore persuasive\u201d the cases concluding that \u201ca clause excluding [coverage] for specific conduct should prevail over a more general severability provision.\u201d <em>(California Casualty, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 1682, 1697.) \u201cIndeed,\u201d the court observed, \u201cacceptance of Yessian\u2019s position would effectively nullify exclusions from coverage in any case involving married coinsureds and a policy with a severability provision. ... It is inconceivable that parties to a policy would include clauses specifically excluding coverage for claims based on certain types of conduct, but intend those exclusions to have no effect in any case involving claims against coinsured spouses.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1697-1698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The severability discussion in <em>California Casualty, </em>is arguably dictum, since the Court of Appeal appeared to believe the exclusion applied directly to the wife by virtue of her personal conduct. Moreover, it is unclear the extent to which the court\u2019s narrow construction of the severability provision stemmed from its particular concern that exclusionary clauses might be nullified in actions against the community for the torts of a single spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Such concerns are not present here. Any liability of Kelly\u2019s parents for Christopher\u2019s death is-not merely vicarious or derivative. Instead, their liability is premised on the <em>independent </em>theory that they negligently failed to supervise and control Kelly\u2019s access to the firearm with which Christopher was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Under the instant circumstances at least, I am persuaded by the cases concluding that when a multiparty liability insurance policy contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>severability provision, the effect is to extend both the policy\u2019s coverage, and its exclusions, <em>individually </em>to <em>each </em>insured, as if he or she were the <em>only </em>insured, subject to policy limits. Under this rule, exclusions from coverage are <em>personal </em>and may not be imputed from one insured to another, even where, as here, language internal to an exclusionary clause, viewed in isolation, could be read to withdraw coverage from all insureds for the excludable conduct of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">These conclusions follow from established California principles governing the construction of insurance contracts. Insurance policies, like all contracts, apply according to their plain terms but must be interpreted when ambiguous. Whether policy language is clear or ambiguous is determined in context, not by viewing words or phrases in isolation. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) If a provision has more than one reasonable meaning, the ambiguity is resolved in favor of coverage a lay policyholder would reasonably expect. <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU).) </em>A corollary of this rule is that exclusions from coverage' are narrowly construed to afford the coverage reasonably anticipated. <em>(Garvey v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 395, 406 [257 Cal.Rptr. 292, 770 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Here, even if the illegal act exclusion\u2019s reference to \u201can\u201d insured might be deemed collective when viewed alone (e.g., <em>Warwick, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 190, 194-195; <em>Altieri, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1360-1361), the policy\u2019s severability clause contradicted any such inference by stating that \u201c[t]his insurance applies <em>separately </em>to each insured.\u201d (Italics added.) Safeco identifies no meaning for this provision other than the one apparent from its words, i.e., that each of multiple insureds under the policy was to be treated, within policy limits, as though the policy applied <em>only </em>to him or her. This promise of severable interests would be rendered meaningless if the single word \u201can\u201d in the exclusionary clause were nonetheless found to prevail, and to make the exclusion collective. (Cf. <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Nor would such a construction satisfy the reasonable expectations of the insureds. It is unlikely Kelly\u2019s parents understood that by <em>extending </em>their homeowners\u2019 coverage to include Kelly as an additional insured, they were actually <em>narrowing their own coverage </em>for claims arising from his torts. In light of the severability provision, Safeco\u2019s intent to achieve that result was not clearly expressed, and the ambiguity must be resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Applying these principles to the facts of the instant case, I conclude that the illegal act exclusion in Safeco\u2019s policy does <em>not </em>withdraw coverage from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Kelly\u2019s parents for liability arising from their alleged negligence in allowing Kelly to shoot Christopher. As to Kelly\u2019s parents, I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and would instruct that court to remand with directions to enter summary judgment for the insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> Under the facts of this case, there can be no ambiguity about whether the policy excluded acts which, though technically forbidden or unathorized by law, resulted in mere accidental death or injury. In the first place, the only injuries the policy purported to cover at all were those arising from \u201caccident[s]\u201d; hence, the policy\u2019s <em>exclusions, </em>such as that for an insured\u2019s illegal act, would be superfluous unless applied to injuries which might be considered accidental. Moreover, the policy also contained express exclusions for injuries which were (1) \u201cexpected or intended\u201d by an insured or (2) \u201cthe foreseeable result of an act or omission intended\u201d by an insured, thus suggesting that an intentional act or injury was not a prerequisite to the distinct illegal act exclusion. Finally, application of the exclusion here does not arise simply because an act the law happens to forbid produced an accidental injury. As discussed above, the illegal act one commits when he points a firearm at a human being and deliberately pulls the trigger, causing the weapon to discharge and kill, is far beyond mere inadvertence or commonplace negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> The <em>Nemetz </em>court agreed that public policy might bar coverage for wife if her tacit involvement in husband\u2019s arson plan rendered her less than \u201cinnocent.\u201d <em>(Nemetz, supra, </em>400 N.W.2d <em>33, 38.) However, </em>the court concluded that this issue had been waived on appeal by the insurers\u2019 failure to pursue it at trial. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 38-39.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> See also <em>Transport Indem. Co. v. Wyatt </em>(Ala. 1982) 417 So.2d 568, 570-571, holding that in a policy with multiple insureds, and containing a severability provision, an exclusion for injuries to \u201cany employee of any Insured\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 569) applies only to an employee of the entity seeking coverage in the particular case. Other cases have reached a contrary conclusion, holding that a severability provision does not prevail over language in the exclusionary clause itself indicating that the exclusion is to apply collectively rather than individually.

Austin and York, Buresh &amp; Kaplan for Defendant and Respondent.</p>\n<p>[Opinion certified for partial publication.<sup>[*]</sup>]</p>\n<p>OPINION</p>\n<p>STEIN, J.</p>\n<p>Nancy Bartlome appeals from a judgment in favor of respondent State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty (State Farm) in a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p>After settling her personal injury claim for the limits of a commercial liability policy issued to \"Tahoe Boat Rental,\" Bartlome sought to establish additional coverage under a personal liability umbrella policy issued by State Farm to Lloyd Canton, one of the partners of Tahoe Boat Rental. On appeal she contends the operators of the boat that caused her injury were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1238</span> insureds under Canton's policy because any property owned by the partnership was also \"owned by\" Canton, as an individual.</p>\n<p>We hold that the definition of \"insureds,\" as including permissive users of boats \"owned by\" the named insured under Canton's personal liability policy, did not include permissive users of a boat owned by the partnership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTS</h2>\n<p>On July 7, 1986, a motorboat operated by Warren Eacret collided with appellant causing the amputation of one of her legs below the knee. Kreg Eacret rented the boat from Tahoe Boat Rental earlier that day. The motor boat was registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles in the name of \"Tahoe Boat Rental,\" which is a California partnership formed for the purpose of renting pleasure boats along the northwest shore of Lake Tahoe. Lloyd Canton and John Kearns are the sole partners of Tahoe Boat Rental.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive business liability policy issued by United National Insurance Company to Tahoe Boat Rental was in effect on the date of this boating accident. The boat involved in the accident was specifically identified as a covered boat in the United National policy, which provided coverage in the amount of $500,000 for losses arising from the operation of the Tahoe Boat Rental business.</p>\n<p>Appellant filed a personal injury action against Kreg Eacret, Warren Robert Eacret, and Lloyd Canton and John V. Kearns both individually and doing business as the general partnership \"Tahoe Boat Rental.\" United National Insurance Company acknowledged that its comprehensive business policy issued to Tahoe Boat Rental provided coverage and the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in the payment of the United National policy limit of $500,000 to appellant.</p>\n<p>Appellant continued to pursue the instant declaratory relief action against State Farm which had issued a policy entitled \"Personal Liability Umbrella Policy\" to Lloyd E. Canton and his wife Sharon.</p>\n<p>The trial court held that the Eacrets were not \"insureds\" under Canton's personal liability umbrella policy because the boat involved in the accident belonged to the partnership and was not \"owned\" by Canton, the named insured.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1239</span> ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellant relies on the following portion of the definition of \"insured\" as the basis for finding coverage for the Eacrets: \"any person or organization while using or holding an automobile, recreational motor vehicle, or watercraft owned, rented by, or loaned to the named insured, provided that the named insured gave permission for the type of use.\" (1a) Appellant contends that the Eacrets were permissive users of a boat \"owned\" by Lloyd Canton, and that they therefore are insureds as defined by Canton's personal liability umbrella policy. She asserts that, despite the absence of any facts showing that Canton considered the boat, which was registered to the partnership, to be his personal property, or that he exercised any actual control over it, he must nonetheless be deemed the \"owner\" of each of the partnership's specific assets because a partnership is not an entity, but rather is an \"aggregation of individuals.\"</p>\n<p>(2) It is by now well established that words used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to their plain meaning, and the courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists. (<i>Reserve Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Pisciotta</i> (1982) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194203\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194203/reserve-insurance-co-v-pisciotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 807 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194203\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194203/reserve-insurance-co-v-pisciotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

If an ambiguity does exist it shall be construed against the insurer, if that construction conforms to the reasonable expectations of the insured. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 808.) If, however, a term in an insurance policy has been judicially construed, it is not ambiguous and the judicial construction of the term should be read into the policy unless the parties express a contrary intent. (2 Couch on Insurance (2d ed. 1984) \u00a7 15:20; <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Chinn</i> (1969) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span>, 279 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span>].)</p>\n<p>(1b) Neither party cites any California case specifically addressing the question whether a policy insuring permissive users of property \"owned\" by an individual also covers permissive users of property of a partnership of which the individual is a member. We are persuaded by cases from other jurisdictions, by our own interpretation of California partnership law, and the particular facts of this case that the term \"owned by ... the named insured\" in Canton's personal liability insurance policy cannot include a boat registered to Tahoe Boat Rental, and used exclusively for partnership purposes.</p>\n<p>(3), (1c) The premise of appellant's argument is that individual partners must be deemed the owners of partnership property because a partnership is merely an aggregation of individuals. In support of this proposition she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1240</span> relies on several cases that she contends stand for the proposition that California follows the \"aggregate theory of partnership\": <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Industrial Acc. Com.</i> (1937) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></span>] and <i>National Auto Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Indus. Acc. Com.</i> (1938) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612765\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612765/national-auto-ins-co-v-indus-acc-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span> </a></span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></span>].<sup>[1]</sup> Although these cases do announce that general principle, California law treats a partnership as a \"hybrid\" organization that is viewed as an aggregation of individuals for some purposes, and as an entity for others. (<i>Epstein</i> v. <i>Frank</i> (1981) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>, 119 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span>].) One of the primary areas in which a partnership is viewed as an entity is with respect to ownership of property. California Corporations Code section 15008 specifically provides that a partnership may hold title to real property, and further defines any property, real or personal, that is acquired \"on account of the partnership,\" as partnership property.</p>\n<p>California Corporations Code section 15025 defines an individual partner's interest in specific partnership assets. Section 15025 begins by stating that \"[a] partner is coowner with the other partners of specific partnership property holding as a tenant in partnership\"; however, the restrictions placed on an individual partner's interest in partnership property by section 15025 are all encompassing. The section states that a partner has no right to possess specific partnership property for nonpartnership purposes without the consent of his fellow partners; it prohibits a partner from assigning or selling his interest in specific partnership property without the consent of his partners; it prohibits enforcement of a money judgment against specific partnership property in connection with the debt of an individual partner; it requires that the right to specific partnership property vests in surviving partners rather than in the estate of a deceased partner; and it states that specific partnership property is not the community property of any individual partner. Thus, most of the normal incidents of ownership are held by the partnership as a group rather than the individual partners.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The only California case arguably addressing the issue whether a partner possesses what are commonly understood as the rights of an owner, with respect to specific partnership assets, is <i>Becker</i> v. <i>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co.</i> (1975) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2140871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2140871/becker-v-state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>]. In that case the plaintiff was injured by a truck the parties characterized as \"owned by\" a partnership. The plaintiff obtained a settlement for the limits of the policy issued to the partnership and then sought declaratory relief that a policy issued to one of the partners, individually, also provided coverage. That policy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1241</span> provided coverage to the individual for damages arising out of the use of an automobile \"owned by\" him or for nonowned vehicles \"used by the named insured or a relative.\" The court stated that the truck was not owned by the individual partner but rather was owned by the partnership. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 285.) <i>Becker,</i> while instructive, is not dispositive of this issue for two reasons: The policy in <i>Becker</i> defined an \"owned automobile\" as one which was listed in the declarations, a temporary substitute or a newly acquired automobile. The truck was not listed in the declarations. Thus, the court's statement that the individual partner did not \"own\" the partnership's truck may have been based on this definition. Second, the court stated later in its opinion that it was stipulated that the truck was \"owned by the partnership.\"</p>\n<p>Respondent cites <i>Mission Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Feldt</i> (1964) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1420685\"><a href=\"/opinion/1420685/mission-ins-co-v-feldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span> </a></span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></span>] as authority for the proposition that an individual partner should not be deemed the \"owner\" of a vehicle registered to the partnership. In <i>Mission Ins.</i> a vehicle registered to a joint venture was involved in an accident. One of the partners of the joint venture had an automobile liability policy that provided coverage only for the use of a motor vehicle \"not owned\" by the individual partner. At the time he took out the policy he did not own any vehicles and had not yet formed the joint venture. The court held that the vehicle was \"not owned\" by the individual partner despite the fact that, as a partner, he had an \"equitable interest\" in the vehicle. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 102.) This case is also distinguishable because the decision to construe ownership to mean only registered ownership was based primarily on certain Vehicle Code provisions requiring proof of financial responsibility that were relevant to the particular policy in that case.</p>\n<p>There are, however, persuasive decisions from other jurisdictions that are directly on point. In <i>Employers Cas. Co.</i> v. <i>Employers Commercial Union</i> (5th Cir.1980) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382968\"><a href=\"/opinion/382968/employers-casualty-company-a-corporation-v-employers-commercial-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, an individual, Robert Owens, was a member of several partnerships including Russellville Steel Company, and Owens Fabricating. A vehicle that was owned by Russellville was involved in an accident while being driven by an employee of Owens Fabricating. A condition of the Commercial Union policy in dispute provided that it was only excess insurance as to any vehicles not owned by the named insured, Robert Owens dba Owens Fabricating. The issue before the court was whether Robert Owens was also an owner of the truck by virtue of his status as a partner in Russellville. If Robert Owens did not own the truck, Commercial Union was only an excess insurer. Employers, the insurer of Russellville, made an argument in support of its claim for contribution identical to that advanced by appellant in this case: \"Employers argues that Alabama has rejected the entity concept of a partnership and adopted the theory that a partnership is merely an aggregate of its individual members. Thus, any property owned by the partnership of Owens and Brignet, doing business as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1242</span> Russellville, would be owned, separately and severally, by Owens and Brignet.\" (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1219.)</p>\n<p>The court rejected this argument based on its interpretation of the relevant provision of the Alabama partnership law, which is identical in all substantive respects to section 25 of the Uniform Partnership Act and California Corporations Code section 15025. The court reasoned as follows: \"Alabama has adopted the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) with some modifications not material to our discussion. Although Ala. Code \u00a7 10-8-72(a) (UPA \u00a7 25(a)) states that `[a] partner is a co-owner with his partners of specific partnership property holdings as a tenant in partnership,' it proceeds to destroy the traditional incidents of ownership. For example, a partner has no right to possess the property without the consent of the partners; a partner's right to specific partnership property is not assignable; and the right to property vests in the surviving partners rather than the estate of a deceased partner. One authority has made the following observation:</p>\n<p>\"Although stating that each partner is a co-owner of the partnership property, the [\u00a7 25 of the Uniform Partnership] Act systematically destroys the usual attributes of ownership.... Functionally, despite the literal language, the <i>partnership owns its property and the partners do not.</i> The Act would be better if it conceded this rather than accomplishing it by indirection. Crane and Bloomberg, <i>Law of Partnership</i> \u00a7 40(b) (1968) (footnotes omitted) (italics added).\" (632 F.2d at pp. 1219-1220.)</p>\n<p>Another federal court reached the same conclusion in <i>Saint Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co.</i> v. <i>Heflin</i> (D.C.Ark. 1956) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1480404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1480404/saint-paul-mercury-indemnity-co-v-heflin/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>. In that case the court, analyzing the same provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act, held that an individual partner was not the owner of a vehicle purchased with partnership funds and used only for partnership purposes. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 523.)</p>\n<p>(4) We consider these decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting provisions of the Uniform Act as persuasive authority. (<i>Estate of Butler</i> (1947) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></span>].)</p>\n<p>(5) Appellant, attempting to distinguish <i>Employers,</i> argues that the court's analysis in that case is inapplicable because that case involved a dispute between two insurers. She contends that in the context of this case, \"`owner' would be defined in the broadest sense and would include ... a partner like CANTON.\" Underlying appellant's argument is an assumption that the term \"owned by\" is ambiguous as applied to the interest of a partner in specific partnership assets. Although the concept of ownership <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1243</span> may be ambiguous in other contexts (see, e.g., <i>Allstate Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Condon</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span>, 151 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2135907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2135907/allstate-ins-co-v-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>]), it is not in this case in light of the provisions of the California Corporations Code and prior judicial construction of the term as applied to these facts. (<i>Producers Dairy Delivery Co.</i> v. <i>Sentry Ins. Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></span>, 916, fn. 7 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span>].)</p>\n<p>(6) Even assuming, arguendo, the term is ambiguous the interpretation urged by appellant is unreasonable in light of the extrinsic evidence admitted below. In his application Canton never disclosed his partnership affiliation. Appellant asserts that this was purely inadvertent because the policy was routinely renewed after Canton became a partner without amending the application. Appellant's argument misses the point. The significance of this omission is not that Canton intentionally misrepresented the facts on his application; rather, the failure to make any effort to correct this omission strongly supports the inference that Canton did not expect or intend that this personal liability umbrella would provide coverage for losses incurred through his business partnership. Further support for this inference is found in the fact that all of the policies listed as underlying insurance in the application for the umbrella policy were clearly policies covering vehicles owned by Canton and/or his wife, individually.</p>\n<p>(1d) In addition to the insurance application, respondent offered Canton's deposition testimony that he never used the boat for his personal purposes. Appellant offered no evidence that Canton in any way exercised dominion and control over the boat, or that there was any commingling of his personal property with partnership assets. Thus, there was no evidence to refute the characterization of the boat as partnership property as defined by California Corporations Code section 15008.</p>\n<p>In light of these facts, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of Canton's personal liability umbrella policy is that the boat registered to Tahoe Boat Rental, and used exclusively for partnership purposes, was not \"owned by\" Lloyd Canton individually. Our decision should not, however, be construed to mean that a vehicle legally registered to a partnership can never be deemed \"owned by\" one of the individual partners for purposes of finding insurance coverage under a definition of \"insured\" such as the one set forth in Canton's personal liability umbrella coverage policy. We merely reject the proposition that an individual partner is, in effect by operation of law, deemed the owner of specific partnership assets, simply by virtue of his status as a partner. As the court below observed, the effect of such an interpretation would be to permit individuals, who also happen to be members of partnerships, to take out personal liability policies at a comparatively <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1244</span> small premium and then read into them coverage for any number of undisclosed partnerships.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.<sup>[*]</sup></h2>\n<p>.... .... .... .... .... .</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Racanelli, P.J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 976 and 976.1, this opinion is certified for partial publication.

Lomes and William Low were the sole shareholders of Newton Wholesale Co., Inc., a wholesale grocery business that developed a computer software program to track inventories and evaluate food prices. When their business relationship soured, Low wrested control of Newton and ousted Lomes both as an employee and as president, although Lomes remained a director and minority shareholder. Lomes sued Newton Wholesale and Low in federal court, and Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest provided a defense to Low and Newton in that action. However, Hartford refused to defend Lomes against the federal counterclaim filed by Low and Newton. Lomes then sued Hartford in state court over its failure to provide him a defense in the federal action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Federal Action</i></h2>\n<p>In his 1996 federal complaint against Newton Wholesale and Low (<i>Lomes v. Newton Wholesale Co. Inc.</i> (C.D.Cal., 1996, No. CV-96-01483DDP) (VAPx)), Lomes alleged copyright infringement involving the software program he and Low had developed together (Lomes had registered a copyright for the program after being fired), unfair competition, and federal and state securities fraud.</p>\n<p>Newton Wholesale and Low filed a federal counterclaim against Lomes, as \"an individual,\" alleging defamation, conversion, intentional interference with existing and prospective economic relations, breach of fiduciary duty, and misappropriation of trade secrets. It alleged, among other things, that after leaving Newton, Lomes telephoned a lender, and made false and defamatory statements that caused Newton to lose its financing. Nine months after the counterclaim was served, Lomes tendered his request for defense costs and indemnity to Hartford, claiming he had been sued for damages resulting from his activities as Newton's director. Hartford paid Lomes $10,000 to temporarily fund his defense under a reservation of rights. Hartford refused to provide more on grounds that most of the counterclaims did not seek damages for injuries covered by the policy, and Lomes was excluded from the one that did, namely defamation (as a form of personal injury), because he was no longer employed by the company or carrying out his duties as a director when he allegedly slandered Newton Wholesale and Low.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the federal district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Newton Wholesale on a claim by Lomes that he was entitled to reimbursement for attorney fees, finding that while \"[i]ndeed, Newton's Articles of Incorporation provide[ ] for reimbursement of officers and directors sued in their capacity as such[,] Lomes ... is not being sued in his capacity as an officer or director\u0097Lomes is the plaintiff, and his role as a counterclaim defendant is unrelated to his officer/director status.\"</p>\n<p>On August 15, 1997, the federal court granted another partial summary judgment in favor of Newton Wholesale and Low, and dismissed all remaining claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> and counterclaims. Lomes appealed; the Ninth Circuit affirmed (<i>Lomes v. Newton Wholesale Co., Inc.</i> (Feb. 14, 2000, Nos. 97-56566, 98-56782) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span> </span>(2000).) The counterclaim was not refiled in state court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The State Action</i></h2>\n<p>Lomes sued Hartford in state court for breach of contract, bad faith, and declaratory relief regarding the duty to defend and indemnify. (<i>Lomes v. The Hartford Ins. Co. of the Midwest</i> (Super.Ct. L.A. County, 1997, No. BC180247)).<sup>[1]</sup> Hartford demurred, contending Lomes was not acting as an officer or director when the alleged wrongful acts occurred. The trial court overruled Hartford's demurrer, finding a possibility for coverage for acts allegedly committed by Lomes in his capacity as director. We summarily denied Hartford's petition for review of that ruling (B121101, May 14, 1998), and the California Supreme Court declined review (S070572, July 15, 1998).</p>\n<p>Lomes moved for summary adjudication of the cause of action for declaratory relief that Hartford had a duty to defend and indemnify him in the federal counterclaim action.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted the motion, finding that Newton's insurance policy covered defamation, that Lomes was acting as a Newton director when he talked to bankers and allegedly slandered Low and that, therefore, Hartford had a duty to defend. We summarily denied Hartford's petition for a writ (B131139, May 19, 1999) and the California Supreme Court declined review (S079344, June 2, 1999).</p>\n<p>Hartford then filed a motion for summary adjudication on the issue of damages, which the court granted, stating: \"Defendant [Hartford] pi-eviously tendered a cheek for $10,000.00 to cover defense costs in the cross-complaint. In this motion Defendant has established and Plaintiff has not been able to counter the evidence that shows that Plaintiffs defense costs are less than $10,000.00, to wit about $7,700.00. That being the case, Plaintiff has not established he suffered any damages from Defendant[`]s breach of the contract.\" The court entered judgment for Hartford on all remaining claims, in effect ending the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>THE CURRENT APPEAL</h2>\n<p>Lomes appealed from the portion of the judgment granting summary adjudication to Hartford regarding contract damages. Hartford filed a cross-appeal from the portion of the judgment granting summary adjudication to Lomes regarding the duty to defend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>\"A summary adjudication motion is subject to the same rules and procedures as a summary judgment motion. Both are reviewed de novo. [Citations.]\" (<i>Lunardi v. Great-West Life Assurance Co.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, an insurer has a duty to defend only if it becomes aware of, or if the third-party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insurance policy. (<i>Id.</i>) If there is no potential for coverage, there is no duty to defend. (<i>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. v.

(<i>Waller v. Truck Ins.

That determination usually is made by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. (<i>Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. Co.</i> (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1252,1259, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, the commercial general liability (\"CGL\") policy issued by Hartford to Newton Wholesale provided coverage for \"bodily injury and property damage,\" defined as physical injury to a person or physical injury to tangible property, and for \"personal and advertising injury,\" including defamation.</p>\n<p>The only counterclaim arguably covered by the policy was Lomes' alleged defamation of Newton Wholesale and Low. Long after he left Newton, Lomes is said to have telephoned a lender, GP Factors, in April 1996 to suggest that Newton Wholesale was unstable and not creditwortny, that Low was dishonest, and that he (Lomes) would be taking over the company.</p>\n<p>The section of the policy defining \"who is an insured\" states in pertinent part: \"If you are designated in the Declarations as: [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] c. An organization other than a partnership or joint venture, you are an insured. Your executive officers and directors are insureds, <i>but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors.</i> Your stockholders are also insureds, <i>but only with respect to their liability as stockholders.\"</i> (Ital.added.) The named insured was Newton Wholesale Co., Inc., identified as a corporation.</p>\n<p>Lomes was sued as an individual, not as a director. And, while it was undisputed that Lomes was still a director at the time of his alleged acts, he would also have had to be fulfilling his duties as an officer or director of Newton Wholesale to qualify for coverage. Lomes offered no evidence in support of his motion for summary adjudication that his actions were taken as a director on behalf of Newton; instead, he asserts on appeal that \"it is certainly within the realm of `possibility' that [he] made these statements in the course of advertising or soliciting lending activity for Newton as one of its directors.\" However, he cannot reasonably be said to have been acting in his capacity as a Newton Wholesale director when he allegedly defamed the corporation and his former partner. Such statements could hardly be considered helpful in attracting lenders to Newton. Lomes had already been fired and was working elsewhere, and Lomes testified at his deposition that he could not recall performing <i>any</i> services on behalf of Newton Wholesale after August of 1995.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> General liability insurance is intended to protect an insured corporation (and its officers and directors) against corporate liability to third parties, not to provide coverage for suits between directors or officers. (<i>Milazo v. Gulf Ins. Co.</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></span>, 1537-1538, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2128025\"><a href=\"/opinion/2128025/milazo-v-gulf-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>.) As Hartford's attorney told the court, \"I do think that there is ... a serious problem with using Newton Wholesale's own insurance policy to afford the defense for someone who sued Newton Wholesale and who allegedly has taken action against Newton Wholesale.\" The question of whether a director can claim status as an insured under a corporation's policy after initiating litigation against that corporation raises important issues of public policy not directly addressed by the California courts in a published opinion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Milazo,</i> the California case most analogous to the situation before us, Division Three of this Court reversed a trial court's summary judgment for defense costs and indemnity granted to a meat market's limited partner, Milazo, finding that the CGL policy issued by Gulf Insurance covered Milazo's liability as a partner, but not as an individual. His conduct in destroying the market's ability to remain in business could not, as a matter of law, have been conducted in his capacity as a partner. (<i>Milazo v. Gulf Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 224 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1538-1539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2128025\"><a href=\"/opinion/2128025/milazo-v-gulf-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>\"To hold that a partner could be covered under a partnership general liability policy for his acts <i>against</i> the very business organization that gives him his status as an insured person would turn the concept of partnership coverage on its head. We therefore conclude that when a partner acts to misappropriate a partnership asset, interest or economic opportunity or to otherwise deprive the partnership thereof he cannot, as a matter of law, be deemed to be acting in his capacity as a partner.\" (<i>Milazo v. Gulf Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 224 Cal. App.3d at p. 1539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2128025\"><a href=\"/opinion/2128025/milazo-v-gulf-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, italics in second sentence omitted.)</p>\n<p><i>Milazo</i> involved a partnership, not a corporation as here. While a partner may act independently within a partnership's usual course of business (Corp. Code, \u00a7 16301), the powers of a director of a corporation are more circumscribed. A corporation does not act through individual directors but, rather, through its board of directors. (Corp.Code, \u00a7 300; <i>Findley v. Garrett</i> (1952) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span>, 174, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></span>.) An individual director has no authority to take action on behalf of the corporation without the consent of the Board of Directors. (See <i>Sammis v. Stafford</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1935</span></span>, 1941-1942, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span> </span>[director's unilateral acts are not binding on corporation unless ratified by the board].)</p>\n<p>In this case, Lomes does not contend Newton's board had authorized him to contact the lender and make statements harmful to Newton's loan application. As there are no facts to support Lomes' claim that he was acting in his capacity as a director, we conclude, as a matter of law, he was sued purely in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p>Courts in other jurisdictions have applied the <i>Milazo</i> court's reasoning to factually similar situations, that is, to cases in which the alleged misconduct did not involve corporate liability for injury to a third party but was rather an internal dispute. (See, e.g., <i>Winther v. Valley Ins.

As the court explained in <i>Milazo,</i> \"the fact of Milazo's status as a partner, while sufficient to create the fiduciary relationship which was breached by his wrongful acts, did not establish that such acts were committed in his capacity as a partner.\" (<i>Milazo v.

Hartford asserts collateral estoppel for the first time on appeal. Having independently reviewed the counterclaim and the insurance policy to arrive at our decision, however, we need not reach that issue.</p>\n<p>[4]  Lomes says in passing that Hartford should have defended him because it defended Low in a \"mirror-image\" lawsuit, involving \"virtually identical claims.\" Lomes' complaint and Newton Wholesale and Low's counterclaim were not the same, the two men were not similarly situated, and Lomes offers no supporting argument. We thus need not address this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",

Kingston for Plaintiffs and Respondents.</p>\n<p>OPINION</p>\n<p>FRIEDMAN, Acting P.J.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Guntert and two wholly owned corporations operate a steel construction and machinery business on a seven-acre tract called Banner Island leased from the City of Stockton. A clause of the lease permits termination by the lessor on 18 months' written notice when and if the city decides to accept a bona fide development offer from third parties.<sup>[1]</sup> In March 1972 the city received what its governing officials viewed as an attractive development offer. They gave Guntert notice of termination. Guntert and his two corporations filed an injunction and damage suit, charging invalidity of the notice of termination.</p>\n<p>A bifurcated trial took place. The first phase of the trial dealt with the parties' substantive claims and with Guntert's prayer for injunctive relief against the city's termination effort. At the conclusion of the first trial phase, the court entered findings declaring that the city had acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, without good faith and in breach of its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> contractual duty to inquire into the bona fides of the third parties' development offer. The court concluded that the notice of lease termination was a nullity and issued an injunction against dispossession of Guntert. In November 1974 we affirmed the judgment of injunction. (<i>Guntert</i> v. <i>City of Stockton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112022/guntert-v-city-of-stockton/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>In the meantime the trial of Guntert's damage claim had gone forward. The trial culminated in findings and a judgment awarding Guntert $553,812.81 (representing lost profits and out-of-pocket losses to the date of trial) plus a monthly sum of $13,442.53 (representing future lost profits) from February 1974 through December 1979, or until earlier termination of the lease. We now consider the city's appeal from the money judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>(1a) The city claims lack of substantive liability for damages. It points out that Guntert did not vacate the leased property but remained in possession. The city's thesis runs approximately as follows \u0097 no cause of action for constructive eviction arises unless the tenant vacates the premises; a lessor who does not physically eject the tenant but rather seeks to oust him through an invalid notice of termination or an unsuccessful lawsuit is liable for damages only if his action was malicious; the trial court's findings of unreasonableness and even of lack of good faith are not tantamount to a finding of malice.</p>\n<p>The city's position is not well taken. (2) In every lease the landlord impliedly covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises. In California this covenant is partially expressed in Civil Code section 1927, which guarantees the tenant against rightful assertion of a paramount title. Beyond the statutory covenant, the landlord is bound to refrain from action which interrupts the tenant's beneficial enjoyment. (<i>Brown Derby Hollywood Corp.</i> v. <i>Hatton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2619674\"><a href=\"/opinion/2619674/brown-derby-hollywood-corp-v-hatton/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span>, 858 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></span>]; <i>Carter</i> v. <i>Adler,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span>, 70-71 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>]; 49 Am.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 336, p. 351.) (1b) As construed by the trial court and by this court on the prior appeal, the Guntert lease imposed upon the lessor an obligation whose breach profoundly impaired the tenant's beneficial enjoyment.</p>\n<p>A preliminary provision of the lease recited that the lessee would use the property for heavy steel construction and for constructing barges and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> other watercraft, Guntert's business included construction of ships, tugs, barges, floating cranes, dredges and specially designed equipment. It built and rented out highway and canal paving machines. According to the findings, many of the \"to order\" products required extended completion time; income from a particular job might be received months, even years, after its completion; a sustaining backlog of major work was required in order to provide a continuing flow of income.</p>\n<p>As construed on the earlier appeal, the termination clause imposed upon the city a duty to investigate and make a reasonable determination of the bona fides of the development proposal for whose sake it was terminating Guntert's tenancy. (43 Cal. App.3d at p. 213.) The city did not fulfill that duty; rather, with no investigation of the developer's financing ability, it arbitrarily and unreasonably gave Guntert the 18-month termination notice. (43 Cal. App.3d at p. 216.) Immediately after the March 1972 termination notice, Guntert filed suit, seeking an adjudication of the notice's invalidity.</p>\n<p>The termination notice initiated a state of uncertainty which seriously damaged Guntert's business. Pending the outcome of the lawsuit, Guntert had no assurance that his manufacturing plant could occupy the leased premises past the threatened date of eviction, i.e., September 1973. The trial court found that this uncertainty prevented Guntert from undertaking commitments and from bidding on manufacturing jobs. Although the court issued its permanent injunction in April 1973, the city's appeal perpetuated Guntert's inability to predict continued access to his manufacturing plant. Not until January 1975, 60 days after we affirmed the injunction judgment, was the nullity of the termination notice finally adjudicated.</p>\n<p>The trial court found that the city's invalid notice of termination directly caused an unanticipated \"wind-down\" of Guntert's business. The arbitrary and unreasonable notice of termination violated the lessor's implied obligation to abstain from interference with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises. (3) Upon a lessor's breach of lease, the tenant has a choice of remedies. If the broken covenant is a condition precedent in the contract sense, he may elect to move out, cease payment of rent and under some circumstances seek damages. (3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, Real Property, \u00a7\u00a7 505, 506.) He also has the alternative of continuing under the lease and suing for breach-of-contract damages. (<i>Kulawitz</i> v. <i>Pacific etc. Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1164210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1164210/kulawitz-v-pacific-etc-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 672 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>]; see also <i>McAlester</i> v. <i>Landers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span>, 82-84 [11 P. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> 505].) (1c) Guntert chose the latter alternative. At no point did he surrender possession of the leased premises.</p>\n<p>A number of decisions describe a rule declaring that a nonphysical interference with the tenant's enjoyment constitutes a constructive eviction; that the tenant may not recover for the eviction unless he first vacates the premises.

Another version of the rule is that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is not breached until there has been an actual or constructive eviction. (<i>Standard Livestock Co.</i> v. <i>Pentz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3306715\"><a href=\"/opinion/3306923/standard-livestock-co-v-pentz/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 625 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3306715\"><a href=\"/opinion/3306923/standard-livestock-co-v-pentz/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></span>]; <i>Petroleum Collections Inc.</i> v. <i>Swords,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Stated in these terms, the rule is incomplete, for it fails to recognize the tenant's choice of remedies for breach of the lease, namely, his option to stand upon the lease and sue for damages. (<i>Kulawitz</i> v. <i>Pacific etc. Paper <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span></i><i>.</i>) Decisions in other states draw a distinction \u0097 the rule demanding surrender of the premises preceding a suit for impairment of quiet enjoyment is inoperative where the tenant elects to stand upon the lease and claim damages.

The lessor's covenant of quiet enjoyment may be breached by something less than complete ouster, that is, \"some act of molestation, affecting, to his prejudice, the possession of the covenantee.\" (<i>Black</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3301687\"><a href=\"/opinion/3302464/black-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 725 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3301687\"><a href=\"/opinion/3302464/black-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>], quoting <i>Levitzky</i> v. <i>Canning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3300622\"><a href=\"/opinion/3301508/levitzky-v-canning/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>.) In <i>Levitzky</i> the landlord's activities deprived the tenant of the economic benefits of the lease; the tenant's claim to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> damages was upheld even though he remained in possession of the premises. Similarly, <i>Agoure</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span>, 76 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3279543\"><a href=\"/opinion/3281195/agoure-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span>], holds that a tenant in possession may recover damages for breach of the covenant of quiet possession.</p>\n<p>Other cases voice a rule upon which the city relies \u0097 that a landlord's unsuccessful attempt to oust the tenant by a notice of termination or lawsuit is not actionable unless characterized by bad faith or malice. (See, e.g., <i>Lindenberg</i> v. <i>MacDonald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182410\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182410/lindenberg-v-macdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 683 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1436</span></span>]; <i>Black</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3301687\"><a href=\"/opinion/3302464/black-v-knight/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Knight,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 176 Cal. at p. 726; <i>Asell</i> v. <i>Rodrigues,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>].) That rule holds sway where the tenant quits the premises and sues for wrongful eviction. Guntert is not suing for a wrongful, constructive eviction but for the lessor's unjustified and unauthorized interference with his profitable use of the leased property. The rule requiring ouster or surrender prior to suit for wrongful eviction does not preclude the tenant from his election to stand upon the lease, remain in possession and sue for breach of contract damages. (<i>Kulawitz</i> v. <i>Pacific etc. Paper Co</i><i>.</i>) It should be unnecessary to observe that a breach of contract is actionable without requiring the plaintiff to establish bad faith or malice. We affirm Guntert's substantive entitlement to damages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Although Guntert as an individual was the sole lessee, he conducted his business through two corporations, Guntert and Zimmerman Construction Division, Inc. (Construction Division) and Guntert Sales Division, Inc. Guntert was the sole stockholder of both corporations. Both corporations are plaintiffs. All the damages awarded by the trial court were predicated on profit losses suffered by Construction Division as a result of the city's unlawful attempt to terminate the lease.</p>\n<p>(4) Contrary to the city's contention, the award for Construction Division's lost profits was lawful even though the latter was not a formal party to the lease. Although the lease created a single tenancy, Construction Division was one of the beneficiaries. The lease expressly named both corporations as occupants of the premises; collectively, the occupants could recover damages suffered by Construction Division by showing that it was an entity for whose benefit the contract was made.

Many of these \"C\" jobs consisted of marine vessels and heavy specialty equipment built to order; others consisted of highway and canal paving equipment which Construction Division leased out with options to purchase. Relatively small orders were carried in a Miscellaneous Job Account. A continual backlog of \"C\" jobs was necessary in order to provide a sustained flow of revenue. Guntert's testimony showed frequent resort to bank financing to meet manufacturing costs pending future receipt of sales revenue and rental income. Construction Division's books were maintained on a cash basis; its regular fiscal year ended on the last day of each February.</p>\n<p>According to the findings, Construction Division had been preparing to bid on a multi-million dollar, ferry boat construction project prior to the city's abortive termination notice. If valid, the March 1972 termination notice would force Construction Division to vacate its plant in September 1973. Although plaintiffs were resisting the threat of eviction, they were uncertain of victory in the courts. Consequently Construction Division refrained from bidding on the ferry boat project. Similarly, the firm had to forego numerous other jobs in the \"C\" category. Efforts to expand the \"small job\" category proved unsuccessful. The findings declare that after March 1, 1972, Construction Division's income was derived from work orders which originated prior to that date; that work originating and performed after that date supplied no profit. According to the findings, gross income in March 1972 and the following months resulted from jobs completed prior to that time; hence, it was \"pure revenue;\" the costs incurred to produce it had been met in prior fiscal periods.</p>\n<p>As evidence of Construction Division's profits preceding the March 1972 breach, plaintiffs submitted tabulations covering a six-year span of business history up through February 1972. These tabulations depicted Construction Division's annual changes in net worth, adjusted by various factors, during the six-year period. At no time during the history of this one-man corporation had Construction Division paid dividends or distributed profits. Therefore, according to plaintiffs' theory, annual gains in net worth, with appropriate adjustments, would reflect annual before-tax earnings. These tabulations showed a total gain in adjusted worth of $967,862.04 during the six-year period. This sum supplied an annual average of $161,310.34 and a monthly average of $13,442.53, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> which the trial court accepted as Construction Division's history of profit prior to the breach.</p>\n<p>The findings establish a reasonable probability that the city's abortive attempt to terminate the lease caused Construction Division to suffer virtually complete loss of the incoming \"C\" type job orders needed to maintain a sustained flow of revenue. The city's evidentiary attack is centered on the accounting data designed to show a six-year history of profit antedating the breach.</p>\n<p>Profit and loss statements, not periodic balance sheets, represent the orthodox, expected method of demonstrating a history of profit and loss. The \"adjusted net worth\" evidence presented by plaintiffs and accepted by the trial court represented an unconventional, artificial method of showing a shift from a history of profit to one of loss. Prime justification for this artificial method lay in the fact that expenses were habitually incurred in one fiscal period to produce gross revenue in a later fiscal period. Profit and loss statements for the period following the breach might show a heavy cash-basis profit without reflecting diminution in the backlog of work orders needed to assure a continued flow of income. Only after an extended interval and over a period of time would the diminishing work orders result in diminished cash flow. Profit and loss statements, extracted from cash-basis accounts, would fail to mirror the damage to anticipated profit at the time the damage occurred. Some artificial method of portrayal was inevitable.</p>\n<p>Construction Division's cash-basis financial statements (prepared annually as of its fiscal year ending the last day of February) formed the starting point for its six-year tabulation of average annual profit. From these annual statements Mr. Guntert had prepared a six-year tabulation reflecting annual fluctuations in net worth, adjusted to confine these fluctuations to changes in plant operating revenue. Mr. Guntert took the stand to explain the various adjustments used to eliminate extraneous factors. Certified public accountants testified on each side. Although Construction Division's books were maintained and income taxes computed on a cash basis, its accountants also prepared semiannual audits on an accrual basis to meet the demands of surety companies which put up bid bonds. Mr. Lewis, plaintiffs' accountant, compared Construction Division's operations to those of a building contractor, whose business operations were more accurately portrayed by accrual rather than cash accounting. Utilizing the accrual-basis audits prepared for the bonding companies, Mr. Lewis had prepared accrual-basis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> statements which confirmed generally the accuracy of the cash-basis computations contained in Mr. Guntert's tabulation.</p>\n<p>Construction Division's books had been made available to defendant's accounting witness, Mr. Snell. Although Mr. Snell criticized plaintiffs' six-year tabulation in some respects, he conceded that his criticism was not directed at the \"total amount.\" In sum, Mr. Snell did not refute plaintiffs' method of demonstrating historic profits.</p>\n<p>The data of profit loss would not stand up to post-audit by a certified public accountant. Yet it represented a fairly reasonable mode of objectifying data doomed to incorporeality by defendant's breach. In view of the testimony of the two accountants, the trial court was justified in viewing plaintiffs' tabulation as a valid method of establishing, first, a six-year history of profit antedating the breach and, second, a reasonable approximation of the rate of profit lost as a result of the breach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>(10) Much of the city's argument goes to the weight of the fiscal data. The city makes a highly selective attack on the six-year tabulation of net worth. According to that tabulation, net worth attributed to operating profits rose $967,000<sup>[3]</sup> over the six-year period from February 1966 to February 1972. Most of this increase occurred during the first two of the six years. The city arbitrarily selects the last four of the six years, during which net worth decreased $203,000; <i>ergo,</i> the city argues, Construction Division was losing money during the period preceding March 1972.</p>\n<p>The argument rests upon a non sequitur. Although the tabulation shows losses during two of the last four years, it shows gains in the other two. Moreover, the 1972-1973 fiscal year shows a gain attributable to job orders initiated in prior years. Plaintiffs provided a measure of support for their claim of lost profit potential by placing in evidence a tabulation of major jobs not bid because of uncertainties created by the invalid termination notice. The trial court was justified in concluding that a continuance of the historic rate of profit would have occurred had it not been for the breach. (<i>Natural Soda Products Co.</i> v. <i>City of Los <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Angeles,</span> supra</span>,</i> 23 Cal.2d at p. 200.) The evidence of a general course of profitable business and of its interruption by the city's wrongful act was substantial in the sense that it was \"reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\" (<i>Estate of <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Teed,</span> supra</span>,</i> 112 Cal. App.2d at p. 644.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> Despite the general acceptability of plaintiffs' evidence of historic profits, the city has demonstrated several errors affecting the court's finding of $13,442.53 as the average monthly rate of damage. Plaintiffs' net worth figures were ostensibly adjusted to reflect only those changes due to fluctuations in operating revenues and to eliminate extraneous elements. Changes in the value of fixed assets are irrelevant to operating profits. Notwithstanding, a $50,000 increase in the value of \"Facilities &amp; Property\" was permitted to find its way into the computation of net worth for the fiscal year ending February 1968.</p>\n<p>Another error arose from the failure to consider a compromise settlement of two accounts receivable. These had been listed in the net worth tabulation as assets aggregating $118,775.87. During trial Guntert agreed with the customers to accept $99,000 in full settlement of these two accounts. The difference, amounting to $19,775.87, should have been (but was not) reflected by a decrease in net worth.</p>\n<p>The erroneous utilization of these two factors resulted in an unjustified increase in the six-year computation of historic profit. The historic profit of $967,862.04 over the six-year span should be reduced by $69,775.87 (the aggregate of the $50,000 and the $19,775.87 items), reducing the six-year aggregate to $898,086.17. The historic profit used as the basis for calculating plaintiffs' damages must therefore be reduced from an annual average rate of $161,310.34 to one of $149,681.03 and from a monthly average rate of $13,442.53 to $12,473.42.</p>\n<p>The trial court also erred by accepting March 1, 1972, as the date of breach for the purpose of computing Construction Division's loss of profit. The breach occurred on March 15, 1972, the date of the wrongful notice of termination. The computation of damages at a fixed monthly rate from the date of breach to a date preceding trial is at best an artificial means of arriving at a reasonable approximation of plaintiffs' loss. Nevertheless, the computation should not be expanded by including a time period preceding the actual breach of contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>(11a) The remaining component of the $553,812.81 judgment for past damages was the sum of $279,585.23 claimed as out-of-pocket, excessive overhead costs attributable to the breach and incurred in the 20-month period from March 1, 1972, through October 31, 1973. As reflected in the findings, this part of the award was predicated on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> theory that the lease anticipated an orderly \"wind-down\" of Construction Division's business, either toward the end of the lease term or during the 18 months following a valid notice of termination; that the City's void notice of termination forced Construction Division into an \"unprogrammed and unanticipated\" wind-down accompanied by excessive overhead costs which would not have been incurred during the orderly wind-down period contemplated by the lease.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' \"wind-down\" theory has no merit. The lease was a hiring of property by a going business concern. None of the lease provisions dealt with the demise, termination or wind-down of the business at the tenancy's end. None of its provisions hampered Guntert's choice to move to another location or to shut down his business whenever he ceased to occupy Banner Island. Like most other leases, it left the tenant as a free agent at the end of his tenancy. The provision for termination upon 18 months' notice was obviously designed to give Guntert time to prepare for whatever eventuality he chose, wind-down or otherwise. In the silence of the lease, the choice was his. For aught contained in the lease, he might choose to move his plant to a new site, abstaining from any and all interruptions or reductions in work volume and work force. If, absent a breach, Guntert chose to wind down his business and suffer a relative increase in overhead costs, the choice would have been his to make at the time he made it. The finding that the lease or the parties to the lease contemplated an orderly \"wind-down\" receives no support from the lease or from any other evidence.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' theory that the lease <i>contemplated</i> a controlled diminution of volume accompanied by a controlled cutback in overhead is premised upon the <i>Hadley</i> v. <i>Baxendale</i> theory of damages reasonably <i>contemplated</i> by the parties at the time of their contract. (See 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, Contracts, \u00a7 639, pp. 542-543.) Regardless, there is no evidence that the city's abortive termination attempt caused Construction Division's loss of \"excess\" overhead costs as found by the trial court.</p>\n<p>The trial court awarded plaintiffs' recovery for profits they would have gained had it not been for the breach. Profits recovered as the proximate result of a breach are the excess, the net, of revenue over costs; usually they are synonymous with net earnings.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>In limited situations, loss of profit may be fairly computed without reference to overhead. In a suit for profit lost by reason of the defendant's failure to supply or accept materials or services, the plaintiff's fixed or overhead costs might be totally unaffected by the breach, justifying the court in disregarding overhead as a portion of the cost; the gross profit would then be the equivalent of the net profit the plaintiff would have earned under the agreement. (<i>Dallman Co.</i> v. <i>Southern Heater Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(12) Where as here an entire business is injured or interrupted, the measure of recovery must be the net loss, not the gross profits. Fixed or overhead costs then become an essential element in computing the lost profits forming the basis for the damage award. If overhead costs are not increased by the breach, it is error to allow them as damages. (<i>Allen</i> v. <i>Gardner,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, 344-345 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></span>].) To award the plaintiff not only lost profit but also the cost of producing the profit causes a double recovery.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>(11b) The computation which formed plaintiffs' evidence of \"excess\" overhead costs demonstrates that Construction Division suffered no absolute increase in overhead, but only a shift in the latter's ratio to direct costs. Plaintiffs calculated \"normal\" overhead at 114 percent of direct labor costs. During the fiscal year immediately following the breach, overhead was 148 percent and during the next 8-month period 183 percent of direct labor costs. Application of these respective percentages to direct labor costs for the same two periods produced a figure representing combined direct and overhead costs for the 20-month period; utilizing the last figure as a minuend, plaintiff then subtracted a product created by applying the \"normal\" 114 percent to the direct costs for the same 20-month period; the resulting figure was posited as a \"loss\" of overhead costs during the 20-month period.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> Such were the delusory mathematics underlying plaintiffs' claim of \"excessive\" and \"out-of-pocket\" overhead costs. The computation displayed no actual increase in overhead but only a shift of its ratio to direct costs. Overhead was no greater than that required to produce net profit at the rate accepted by the fact trier. The trial court erred by adding to lost profit part of the expense of producing it. No substantial evidence supported the award of \"excess overhead\" amounting to $279,585.23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>(13a) An aggrieved party may recover damages resulting after commencement of his lawsuit or certain to result in the future. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3283.) The findings declare that at the trial Construction Division asked for some assurance of 18 months' tenancy pending the city's appeal to permit it to accept a major barge construction job; that the city rejected the request; that Construction Division then decided to close down its business on November 1, 1973, in order to abate continuing overhead expense; that Construction Division's shutdown was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the situation created by the city's illegal notice of termination; that Construction Division would suffer loss of future profits at the rate of $13,442.53 per month during the remainder of the lease period. Based on these findings, the judgment directed the City of Stockton to pay this sum each month from February 1974 through December 1979 unless the lease ended earlier.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Earlier in this opinion we noted that Civil Code section 3300, providing consequential damages for breach of contract, applies to actions for breach of a landlord's implied covenant of quiet possession. (<i>Standard Livestock Co.</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3306715\"><a href=\"/opinion/3306923/standard-livestock-co-v-pentz/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pentz,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 204 Cal. at p. 642.) A breach of contract may be either total or partial. (14) When a contract is totally breached, the plaintiff recovers all his damages, present and prospective, in a single lawsuit; that sort of recovery substitutes a money award for the defendant's duty to perform; it divests the court of future power to require performance or to award additional damages. (<i>Coughlin</i> v. <i>Blair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617343\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617343/coughlin-v-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>, 598 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171158/coughlin-v-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>].) (15) \"If the breach is partial only, the injured party may recover damages for nonperformance only to the time of trial and may not recover damages for anticipated future <span class=\"star-pagination\">*151</span> nonperformance.... Furthermore, even if a breach is total, the injured party may treat it as partial, unless the wrongdoer has repudiated the contract.... The circumstances of each case determine whether the injured party may treat a breach of contract as total.... If, as in the present case, the injured party has fully performed his obligations under a bilateral contract, courts usually treat a breach as partial....\" (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 598-599; see also <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801201/oliver-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 302 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1151536\"><a href=\"/opinion/1151536/oliver-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>]; Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 313.)</p>\n<p>(13b) Here plaintiffs elected to remain in possession, continue to pay rent and sue for a partial rather than total breach. The lease, whose prime objective was the letting of property, remained alive; the law's remedies were substituted for only a part of the contractual rights; if only by virtue of the injured party's election, the breach was partial and not total. That election was confirmed by the injunction issued at the tenant's behest. That injunction prevented the landlord from interfering with the tenant's quiet possession and use of the leased premises during the remainder of the tenancy.</p>\n<p>By granting an injunction which assured specific performance and, in addition, a judgment for future profits available only on the theory of a total breach of the lease, the trial court awarded something akin to double recovery.<sup>[6]</sup> Plaintiffs occupy an inconsistent position \u0097 they argue (correctly) that their right to damages was not dependent upon eviction, yet they seek a measure of damages available to an evicted tenant, that is, one who no longer has a lease. The breach being partial only, the trial court erred by awarding prospective loss of profits.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend that the lease created separate obligations, running to Guntert's two corporations as well as to Guntert himself; that the city's illegal act caused Construction Division to suffer the effect of a total, not partial, breach, for which it should recover prospective as well as past profits. Plaintiffs cite <i>Noble</i> v. <i>Tweedy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, 744 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></span>], in which the landlord failed to complete a building for the tenant, who nevertheless accepted the premises and sued for damages; the court held that the construction covenant was fully and finally breached and the tenant entitled to future as well as past damages.</p>\n<p>The argument rests upon a misconception. The lease ran from the City of Stockton to Guntert, an individual. Although it recognized Guntert's wholly owned corporations as occupants and beneficiaries, the lease created only one tenancy, an undivided estate for years held by Guntert alone. The lease did not split the estate among joint or common tenants. As a contract, the lease remained in force following the breach. Guntert's decision to close down Construction Division as of November 1, 1973, did not metamorphose the partial breach into totality.</p>\n<p>The award of prospective profits accruing through December 1979 offends another tenet of damage law \u0097 the requirement of reasonable certainty embodied in Civil Code section 3283. Sitting in judgment in February 1974 and facing a lease which did not finally expire until June 1981, the trial court indulged in a shaky prognostication \u0097 that Construction Division's plant could not be reopened or profitably utilized within the remaining years of tenancy. Guntert alone had made the decision to close down the plant. According to the findings, this decision was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the city's breach. Apparently the trial court viewed Guntert's decision as an expression of economic prudence dictated by prevailing uncertainties over outcome of the lawsuit. These uncertainties were put to rest in January 1975, with the finality of this court's decision sustaining injunctive relief. At that time Guntert and his two companies gained assurance of undisturbed occupancy of Banner Island until the end of the lease term (or until an earlier valid termination). Between January 1975 and the ultimate expiration of Guntert's tenancy lay approximately six years of undisturbed occupancy. With the hindsight now available, one views the prospective damage award as an unconditional subsidy, supplying a steady rate of profit to an idle manufacturing plant over a five-year period.</p>\n<p>At this point the distinction between <i>Noble</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tweedy,</span> supra</span></i><i>,</i> and the present case becomes obvious. There the landlord had indulged in a complete breach of the covenant to supply a building. Here, although there was a single breach, the damage arose from its impairment of the tenant's continuing right of quiet enjoyment. When the injunction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*153</span> protected that continuing right against future interference, the tenant's entitlement to damage had to be reappraised.</p>\n<p>Although the trial court found that plant closure was a natural foreseeable consequence of the breach, it did not find that reopening the plant would be uneconomical or unfeasible. Nor is there any evidence to support such a finding.<sup>[7]</sup> Realism suggests that a judgment guaranteeing a steady profit to an idle plant is a strong impetus to continued idleness. (16) A claim for future damage may be maintained despite uncertainty of amount; it may not be maintained in the face of uncertainty as to its occurrence; a mere contingency will not support a claim for damages.

The unavailability of prospective damages does not preclude future awards of past damages flowing from the partial breach. (See generally, 4 Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 956.) Plaintiffs may, within the period of limitations, file a new lawsuit seeking additional damages; in the alternative, they may request the trial court in this case to reserve jurisdiction for the award of further damages. (See <i>United States Liab. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Haidinger-Hayes, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1136348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1136348/united-states-liab-ins-co-v-haidinger-hayes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 599 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1136348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1136348/united-states-liab-ins-co-v-haidinger-hayes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Future applications for additional damages will require plaintiffs to do everything reasonably possible to minimize their loss. (<i>Valencia</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2605626\"><a href=\"/opinion/2605626/valencia-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span>, 844 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span>].) Prolongation of Construction Division's plant closure after January 1975 \u0097 when the injunction judgment became final \u0097 will be one of the elements bearing upon plaintiff's eligibility for award of additional damages for profit losses accruing after the December 1973 trial.</p>\n<p>The judgment awarding damages to plaintiffs is sustained but must be reversed for the purpose of modifying the award of past damages to conform to the views expressed in this opinion. The award of prospective damages is reversed and the court is directed to reconsider in the light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*154</span> this opinion plaintiffs' claim for profit losses accruing subsequent to the December 1973 trial. Each side will bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p>Regan, J., and Evans, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>Petitions for a rehearing were denied February 9, 1976, and the following opinion was then rendered:</p>\n<p>FRIEDMAN, Acting P.J.</p>\n<p>Both plaintiffs and the defendant City of Stockton have filed petitions for rehearing. Except at one point, neither petition evokes any need for modification or amplification of our opinion filed January 12, 1976. We do comment upon plaintiffs' criticism of that section of our opinion (headed by the numeral \"VI\") which nullified the trial court's damage award for loss of future profits at a fixed monthly rate commencing February 1974 and extending through December 1979.</p>\n<p>It will be recalled that in November 1974 this court sustained the injunction which prevented the City of Stockton from terminating the leasehold of plaintiff Guntert. (<i>Guntert</i> v. <i>City of Stockton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span> </span>[<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/2112022/guntert-v-city-of-stockton/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>].) That decision on appeal became final in January 1975. The damage phase of the lawsuit went to trial in December 1973 and the judgment for damages was entered February 1974. The trial court judgment for monthly profit losses commencing February 1974 was prospective in relation to the time of the damage trial and entry of the damage judgment. We reverse that part of the judgment (a) because the breach of lease was only partial and did not entitle plaintiffs to prospective damages; (b) because the occurrence of future damages was contingent and uncertain.</p>\n<p>In their petition for rehearing plaintiffs argue that we should have sustained the award of monthly profit losses at least until the time the injunction judgment became final, that is, until January 1975. Until then, plaintiffs had no assurance of a victorious lawsuit and no assurance of undisturbed occupancy of the site of their manufacturing plant. Until then, plaintiffs' uncertain prospects prevented them from accepting profitable, long-term business commitments. Thus, they assert, we should have affirmed the award of monthly profit losses at least through January 1975.</p>\n<p>At this point plaintiffs overlook the fact that we were reviewing the judgment entered in February 1974, not January 1975. From the trial court's perspective in February 1974, these damages were prospective, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> contingent and erroneous. It is not the province of an appellate court to make an original award of damages after nullifying an invalid, trial court award.</p>\n<p>At this point too, plaintiffs overlook that portion of our opinion which pointed to the availability of remedies for damages which had been prospective at the time of trial. (<i>Ante,</i> p. 153.) Indeed, our decision directs the trial court to \"reconsider in the light of this opinion plaintiffs' claim for profit losses accruing subsequent to the December 1973 trial.\" (<i>Ante,</i> pp. 153-154.)</p>\n<p>In hearing any claim for damages accruing after December 1973, the trial court will have an opportunity to consider any defenses or reductions claimed by the City of Stockton.</p>\n<p>Regan, J., and Evans, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>The petitions of the appellant and the respondents for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied April 22, 1976. Richardson, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The termination clause reads as follows: \"From and after the date of this Agreement. Lessor [City of Stockton] shall have the right to terminate said Lease dated June 1, 1966, upon eighteen (18) months' written notice to Lessee, when the City Council of Lessor has received and agreed to accept a bona fide offer or proposal to develop the demised premises.... The determination as to the validity of said offer or proposal and the economic feasibility and the ability to adequately finance said development shall be at the sole discretion of said City Council.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the matter is not fully explained in the briefs, two reasons appear for selecting December 1, 1973, as the separation point between past and future losses. The damage trial took place in December 1973. On November 1, 1973. Construction Division decided to wind up its business. According to the findings, efforts to find an alternate plant site had been unsuccessful: a number of employees, including key employees, had left because of employment insecurity and lack of work attributable to Construction Division's inability to undertake long-term projects: the closure of Construction Division would abate the continuing outflow of overhead costs.\n</p>\n<p>The mathematics of the findings and judgment are not fully explainable. The period for the award of past profit losses is 21 months. Multiplication of the monthly loss of $13,442.53 by 21 results in a product of $282,293.13 rather than $274,227.58.</p>\n<p>[3]  At this juncture we round off the figures for the sake of simplicity.</p>\n<p>[4]  Thus a leading English text declares: \"Just as expenses rendered futile by the breach may generally be claimed as an alternative to the normal measure of damages, so they may also be claimed as an alternative to recovering for gains prevented by the breach. Again, it is important to realise that such expenses form an alternative and not an additional head of damage, since they represent part of the price that the plaintiff was to incur in order to secure the gain.\" (McGregor on Damages (13th ed. 1972) pp. 32-33.)</p>\n<p>[5]  The award of prospective damage commenced with the month of February 1974 in which the judgment was entered. The December 1979 date was selected because the lease would finally expire in June 1981 and Guntert, in preparation for that event, would commence to \"wind down\" Construction Division's operations 18 months earlier, in December 1979.</p>\n<p>[6]  An analogy appears in the decisions dealing with damages for nuisance. If the nuisance is permanent, the landowner may recover past and prospective damages; if the defendant can or is required by decree to abate the nuisance, the plaintiff's damages are limited to those suffered in the past and may not include speculative future losses based upon the assumption that the nuisance will continue. (<i>Spaulding</i> v. <i>Cameron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190790\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190790/spaulding-v-cameron/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 268-269 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1180755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1180755/spaulding-v-cameron/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>]; <i>Polin</i> v. <i>Chung Cho,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The analogy was noted in <i>Coughlin</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Blair,</span> supra</span>,</i> 41 Cal.2d at page 598, where the court observed: \"[<i>Spaulding</i> v. <i>Cameron</i>] would be in point here, if plaintiffs had obtained both damages for a total breach and a decree of specific performance requiring defendants to perform, or if defendants were still obliged to perform the contract.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Indeed, in November 1973 plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought a stipulation assuring them of 18 months' undisturbed tenancy to permit their acceptance of a major barge construction contract. Only a few months later, in February 1974, the trial court awarded prospective profit losses, implicitly premised upon the assumption that such business opportunities could be ignored or would no longer arise.</p>\n\n</div>",

McGrath as Amici Curiae on behalf of Real Parties in Interest.</p>\n<p>OPINION</p>\n<p>PANELLI, J.</p>\n<p>This declaratory relief action presents issues relating to the scope of a liability insurer's duty to defend its insured in an underlying third party lawsuit. The parties before us \u0097 carriers who issued comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies and the pesticide manufacturer to which the policies were sold \u0097 disagree on the proper use of extrinsic evidence in determining the scope of the defense duty and the nature of the parties' respective burdens on motions for summary adjudication of defense obligations. We conclude that evidence extrinsic to the underlying complaint can defeat as well as generate a defense duty, and that summary adjudication of the defense duty follows the same procedural rules as those applicable in any other type of litigation. Because the Court of Appeal correctly applied the law in this case, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>From 1947 to 1982, Montrose Chemical Corporation of California (Montrose) manufactured the pesticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT) at its facility in Torrance, California. During the 1960's conservationists began to raise serious concerns about the effect of DDT on the environment (see, e.g., Carson, The Silent Spring (1963)), and in 1972 the federal government prohibited its use within this country. Montrose continued to manufacture DDT for export at the Torrance facility until it closed the plant in 1982.</p>\n<p>In 1990 the United States and the State of California sued Montrose in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 et seq.) (CERCLA). (United States, et al. v. Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, et al. (U.S. Dist. Ct. C.D.Cal.), 1990, No. CV 90-3122-AAH (JRx)).) The CERCLA action alleges that Montrose's operation of its Torrance facility caused environmental contamination that damaged land, water, and wildlife in the Los Angeles Harbor and neighboring waters. CERCLA imposes liability without fault on present and former owners of hazardous waste disposal sites, transporters of hazardous wastes, and those who arrange for the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a).) The complaint does not allege that Montrose intentionally caused the alleged contamination. Montrose is also named as a defendant in a cross-complaint filed by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. The cross-complaint alleges that Montrose's operations at the Torrance facility resulted in property damage over a lengthy period, for which Montrose should be held liable on theories of strict liability and negligence.</p>\n<p>Montrose had purchased liability insurance from various carriers<sup>[1]</sup> to cover its operations at the Torrance facility from 1960 to 1986. The carriers issued to Montrose CGL policies in which they promised to defend it against \"any suit ... seeking damages on account of bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false, or fraudulent.\" The carriers also agreed to indemnify Montrose for \"bodily injury or property damage ... caused by an occurrence.\" \"Property damage\" was defined as \"injury to or destruction of tangible property which results during the policy period.\" \"Occurrence\" was defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in ... property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured....\"</p>\n<p>Soon after the filing of the original complaint in the CERCLA action, Montrose gave notice to the carriers and requested that they provide it with a defense pursuant to their policies. Each carrier either denied coverage and declined to defend, or conditioned an offer of a defense on terms Montrose contends were inconsistent with applicable law.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>(1a) Montrose brought a declaratory relief action against the carriers, seeking a declaration that each owed a duty to defend in the federal action and cross-complaint. The carriers denied they owed a duty to defend; each asserted a number of affirmative defenses, including exclusions contained in the various policies.</p>\n<p>Montrose moved for summary adjudication of the insurers' duty to defend. It argued that under <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116541/gray-v-zurich-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116541/gray-v-zurich-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116541/gray-v-zurich-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>], it was entitled as a matter of law to have its insurers defend the underlying CERCLA action because the allegations of the complaint, along with the terms of the CGL policies, created a potential for liability, thus triggering a duty to defend. The insurers countered that Montrose had failed to establish that it was entitled to summary adjudication, and that extrinsic evidence revealed a triable issue of fact regarding whether a potential for liability existed, thus defeating Montrose's motion for summary adjudication of the insurers' defense duty.</p>\n<p>The trial court denied Montrose's motion. It found that Montrose had failed to make a prima facie showing that the CERCLA action created a potential for coverage, reasoning that Montrose could not simply rely on the allegations of the third party's complaint, which were \"neutral\" regarding whether the alleged contamination was caused by an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the policies or by Montrose's regular business practices (which the trial court evidently viewed as outside the concept of \"occurrence\"). Absent an affirmative evidentiary showing that the contamination alleged in the CERCLA complaint resulted from an accident or occurrence, the trial court concluded, Montrose could not show a potential for coverage. The trial court also found that the insurers had adduced extrinsic evidence creating a triable issue of fact as to whether the CERCLA complaint alleged acts within the policies' coverage. According to the trial court, the evidence, if believed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> could support the inference that the alleged contamination resulted from Montrose's deliberate business management practices rather than from an accident or occurrence; therefore, summary adjudication was inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Montrose sought relief by writ in the Court of Appeal. That court first summarily denied Montrose's petition and then, following our order retransferring the cause, granted relief. The Court of Appeal concluded that Montrose had made a prima facie showing of potential liability under the policies. While agreeing with the insurers that facts extrinsic to the underlying complaint may defeat as well as trigger a duty to defend, the Court of Appeal concluded that the insurers' extrinsic evidence did no more than put in dispute whether the acts alleged in the underlying complaint would eventually fall within one or more of the exceptions to the policies' coverage. Such a dispute, the court reasoned, could not defeat the potential for coverage that Montrose had established, and so could not eliminate the duty to defend.</p>\n<p>We granted review.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Recently we had occasion to restate the familiar principles governing adjudication of the insurer's duty to defend. (2a) In <i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>] (<i>Horace Mann</i>), we observed: \"[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity. (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> [<i>supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116541/gray-v-zurich-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span> (<i>Gray</i>)]. As we said in <i>Gray,</i> `the carrier must defend a suit which <i>potentially</i> seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.' (<i>Id.</i> at p. 275, italics in original.) Implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded. [Citations.]\" (<i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> 4 Cal.4th at p. 1081.)</p>\n<p>(3a) \"The determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)\" (<i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> 4 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) As one Court of Appeal has put it, \"[f]or an insurer, the existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance, but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit. [Citation.] Hence, the duty `may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.' [Citation.]\" (<i>Saylin</i> v. <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125682\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125682/saylin-v-california-ins-guarantee-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>(2b) The defense duty is a continuing one, arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded (<i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co.</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1120777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1120777/lambert-v-commonwealth-land-title-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span>, 1077, 1079 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1120777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1120777/lambert-v-commonwealth-land-title-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Imposition of an immediate duty to defend is necessary to afford the insured what it is entitled to: the full protection of a defense on its behalf. (See <i>Signal Companies, Inc.</i> v. <i>Harbor Ins. Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1270451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1270451/signal-companies-inc-v-harbor-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 367 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1270451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1270451/signal-companies-inc-v-harbor-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As a consequence, California courts have been consistently solicitous of insureds' expectations on this score. (See, e.g., <i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>; <i>CNA Casualty of California</i> v. <i>Seaboard Surety Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123121/cna-casualty-of-california-v-seaboard-surety-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>].)</p>\n<p>(3b) <i>Gray</i> made clear that facts known to the insurer and extrinsic to the third party complaint can generate a duty to defend, even though the face of the complaint does not reflect a potential for liability under the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) This is so because current pleading rules liberally allow amendment; the third party plaintiff cannot be the arbiter of coverage. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>(4) Whether extrinsic evidence can <i>defeat</i> the defense duty is a question that has elicited varying responses in the Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p>In <i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Flynt</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127477\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127477/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-flynt/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127477\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127477/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-flynt/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>] (<i>Flynt</i>), an automobile liability insurance policy made permission for use of the car a condition of coverage. While driving a car he had stolen, the insured's stepson was involved in an accident; his passenger brought a personal injury suit. In the insurer's declaratory relief action to determine the extent of its defense duty, the Court of Appeal concluded that, although the passenger's complaint did not allege the car was stolen, the insurer had no duty to defend. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 548.) The <i>Flynt</i> court reasoned: \"If, as stated in <i>Gray,</i> an insurance company may not rely solely on the complaint filed by a third party against its insured to determine its potential liability and duty to defend under an insurance policy, if, in making this determination, it must consider facts it learns from its own insured and from its own investigation, then it follows it may determine from the total facts it learns from all sources that potential liability does not exist under the policy and refuse to defend the suit.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>In <i>Saylin</i> v. <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125682\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125682/saylin-v-california-ins-guarantee-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, the third party complaint alleged that the insured committed tortious acts within the policy period. However, discovery revealed undisputedly that the insured had in fact done nothing concerning the third party while the policy was in force. The Court of Appeal noted that had the insurer known these facts at the outset of the litigation, it would have been justified in denying a defense. Citing <i>Flynt, supra,</i> the court held that the California Insurance Guarantee Association, on behalf of the insolvent insurer, had a duty to determine independently whether the third party claim was covered, and properly denied a defense on ascertaining the facts. (<i>Saylin</i> v. <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra,</i> 179 Cal. App.3d at p. 264.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> In <i>Fire Ins. Exchange</i> v. <i>Jiminez</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2122017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2122017/fire-ins-exchange-v-jiminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>], the claimant in the underlying action was injured on the insured's business premises. The insured sought a defense under his homeowners policy, although the policy expressly excluded business pursuits. The Court of Appeal concluded the insurer had no duty to defend, reasoning that no potential for liability under the policy existed inasmuch as the uncontradicted evidence showed the accident occurred on the business premises; amendment of the third party complaint to state a covered claim was, therefore, impossible. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 442.)</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal in <i>CNA Casualty of California</i> v. <i>Seaboard Surety Co., supra,</i> 176 Cal. App.3d at page 606 (<i>CNA</i>), stated a contrary rule in dictum. That dictum was cited approvingly in <i>Jenkins</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143748\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143748/jenkins-v-insurance-co-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>]. In none of these cases, however, was the principle that an insurer may not resort to extrinsic evidence to defeat a duty to defend embodied in the holding.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the authority that <i>CNA, supra,</i> 176 Cal. App.3d at page 606, cites in support of its pronouncement on extrinsic evidence does not stand for the proposition advanced. In <i>Remmer</i> v. <i>Glens Falls Indem. Co.</i> (1956) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122385/remmer-v-glens-falls-indem-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under such a clause it is the duty of the insurer to defend the insured when sued in any action where the facts alleged in the complaint support a recovery for an `occurrence' covered by the policy, regardless of the fact that the insurer has knowledge that the injury is not in fact covered. (<i>Lee</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i> [2d Cir.1949] <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"223982\"><a href=\"/opinion/223982/lee-v-aetna-casualty-surety-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>; <i>Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Wis.</i> v. <i>Hendrix</i> [4th Cir.1952] <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"230157\"><a href=\"/opinion/230157/employers-mut-liability-ins-co-of-wisconsin-v-hendrix/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span>].) But it is equally true that the insurer is not required to defend an action against the insured when the complaint in that action shows on its face that the injury complained of is not only not covered by, but is excluded from the policy. [Citation.] That is the present case.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 90.) Thus, <i>Remmer,</i> like <i>CNA,</i> merely states in dictum that extrinsic evidence cannot defeat the duty to defend.</p>\n<p>The source of the dicta in <i>CNA</i> and <i>Remmer</i> is <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i> (2d Cir.1949) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"223982\"><a href=\"/opinion/223982/lee-v-aetna-casualty-surety-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span> (<i>Lee</i>). The <i>Lee</i> court held that the validity of a claim of breach of the duty to defend \"depends upon the meaning of the defendant's promise to `defend ... any suit against the Insured alleging injury, sickness, disease or destruction covered by this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> Policy ... even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.' This language means that the insurer will defend the suit, if the injured party states a claim, which, qua claim, is for an injury `covered' by the policy; it is the claim which determines the insurer's duty to defend; and it is irrelevant that the insurer may get information from the insured, or from any one else, which indicates, or even demonstrates, that the injury is not in fact `covered.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 751.) Although the latter sentence, taken in isolation, might seem to describe an indefeasible defense duty, closer examination of the opinion compels a different conclusion. Immediately following the language just quoted, the court said, \"The insurer has promised to relieve the insured of the burden of satisfying the tribunal where the suit is tried, that the claim as pleaded is `groundless.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 752.) The juxtaposition of the two sentences suggests that what the court was getting at was the well-established principle that the insurer may not decline to defend a suit merely because it is devoid of merit, but instead must assert appropriate defenses on its insured's behalf in the underlying action. Later in the opinion, the <i>Lee</i> court stated, \"It follows that, if the plaintiff's complaint against the insured alleged facts which would have supported a recovery covered by the policy, it was the duty of the defendant to undertake the defense, <i>until it could confine the claim to a recovery that the policy did not cover.\"</i> (<i>Id.</i> at p. 753; italics added.) <i>Lee</i> therefore contemplates that the insurer may terminate its defense obligation by proving that the underlying claim falls outside the scope of policy coverage, but not by demonstrating that the claim lacks merit, or might have merit only on some theory outside the scope of coverage. To read <i>Lee</i> as creating a rule of indefeasibility for the defense duty thus is to give it an unwarranted extension. The <i>CNA</i> dictum (<i>supra,</i> 176 Cal. App.3d at p. 606) does not accurately state the law in this respect.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal in the present case followed the <i>Flynt</i> line of decisions, reasoning that \"neither logic, common sense, nor fair play supports a rule allowing only the insured to rely on extrinsic facts to determine the potential for coverage. It would be pointless, for example, to require an insurer to defend an action where undisputed facts developed early in the investigation conclusively showed, despite a contrary allegation in the complaint, that the underlying acts occurred on a date when the policy was not in effect or at a location concededly not covered by the policy. [Citations.] Similarly, where extrinsic evidence establishes that the ultimate question of coverage can be determined as a matter of law on undisputed facts, we see no reason to prevent an insurer from seeking summary adjudication that no potential for liability exists and thus that it has no duty to defend. [Citations.] We see the critical distinction as not whether extrinsic evidence may be considered, but whether such evidence presents undisputed facts which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> conclusively eliminate a potential for liability.\" We concur in the reasoning of the Court of Appeal on this point.</p>\n<p>(5) In holding that the trial court erroneously denied Montrose's motion for summary adjudication of the question whether the insurers owed a duty to defend the CERCLA action, the Court of Appeal stated: \"[O]nce the insured has established potential liability by reference to the factual allegations of the complaint, the terms of the policy, and any extrinsic evidence upon which the insured intends to rely, the insurer must assume its duty to defend unless and until it can conclusively refute that potential. Necessarily, an insurer will be required to defend a suit where the evidence suggests, but does not conclusively establish, that the loss is not covered.... A carrier remains free to seek declaratory relief if undisputed facts conclusively show, as a matter of law, that there is no potential for liability.\"</p>\n<p>Travelers criticizes the Court of Appeal's variously expressed references to \"possibility\" of coverage as the test for whether the insurer owes a duty to defend its insured in the underlying suit. The correct test, Travelers insists, is whether there exists a \"<i>reasonable</i> potential for coverage\" (italics added); this permits the insurer to engage in what Travelers calls a \"factual balancing,\" taking into account disputed and undisputed facts, before making its determination whether to provide its insured with a defense.</p>\n<p>Travelers's argument betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of <i>Gray, supra,</i> and of what is at issue in an adjudication of the defense duty. Because the policy at issue in <i>Gray</i> was ambiguous, and could be read either to exclude or to provide for coverage, we held that ordinary principles of insurance contract interpretation required it be construed in the insured's favor, according to his reasonable expectations. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at pp. 271-272; see also <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>, 1264-1265, 1272 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

As a distinct, separate, and alternative basis for our decision, we recognized that the insured is entitled to a defense if the underlying complaint alleges the insured's liability for damages <i>potentially</i> covered under the policy, or if the complaint might be amended to give rise to a liability that would be covered under the policy. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at pp. 275-276.)</p>\n<p>(3c) The alternative holding in <i>Gray, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116541/gray-v-zurich-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, establishes the rule that the insurer must defend in some lawsuits where liability under the policy ultimately fails to materialize; this is one reason why it is often said that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. (See, e.g., <i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.</i> (1977) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2173501\"><a href=\"/opinion/2173501/fresno-economy-import-used-cars-v-us-fid-guar/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Any doubt as to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured's favor. (<i>United Pacific Ins.

The quoted language cannot reasonably be understood to refer to anything beyond a bare \"potential\" or \"possibility\" of coverage as the trigger of a defense duty. Contrary to Travelers's interpretation, California courts have used the terms \"possibility\" and \"potential\" interchangeably, and we see no difference between them. (See <i>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra,</i> 76 Cal. App.3d at p. 278.)</p>\n<p>Travelers further argues that, although the Court of Appeal correctly recognized that facts extrinsic to the third party complaint may obviate the insurer's defense duty, it erred in reasoning that only <i>undisputed</i> extrinsic evidence can do so. The duty to defend is determined by reference to the policy, the complaint, and <i>all</i> facts known to the insurer from any source. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at pp. 276-277.) If this formulation is limited to undisputed facts, Travelers contends, then an insured can simply refuse to concede facts that take the underlying claim outside the scope of coverage, and thereby set itself up as arbiter of the defense duty. Travelers urges that such a rule effectively exempts determinations of the insurer's defense duty from conventional rules of contract interpretation.</p>\n<p>(6) Travelers again misconceives what is at issue in an action seeking declaratory relief on the issue of the duty to defend. To prevail, the insured must prove the existence of a <i>potential for coverage,</i> while the insurer must establish <i>the absence of any such potential.</i> In other words, the insured need only show that the underlying claim <i>may</i> fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it <i>cannot.</i> Facts merely tending to show that the claim is not covered, or may not be covered, but are insufficient to eliminate the possibility that resultant damages (or the nature of the action) will fall within the scope of coverage, therefore add no weight to the scales. Any seeming disparity in the respective burdens merely reflects the substantive law.</p>\n<p>Travelers raises the specter of intransigent insureds being empowered to block summary judgment, to which insurers are otherwise entitled, with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> mere assertions that coverage may exist. The prospect is apparent rather than real. This is because, as in summary judgment proceedings generally, an insured cannot manufacture a dispute on summary judgment, ipse dixit, by refusing to concede the truth of a fact without adducing some evidentiary support for its position.</p>\n<p>(7) It is appropriate to recall at this point the procedural ramifications of rulings on motions for summary judgment in actions seeking a declaration of the existence or nonexistence of the duty to defend. When an insured successfully moves for summary judgment that the insurer owes a defense duty, the insurer's duty is clear. If an insurer successfully moves for summary judgment that it owes no duty to defend, the absence of a duty is clear. But an unfavorable ruling on the insured's motion does not establish the absence of a defense duty; it merely means that the question whether the insurer must defend is not susceptible of resolution by undisputed facts, but instead must go to trial. In the interim, presumably there continues to exist a potential for coverage and thus a duty to defend. As we said in <i>Horace Mann, supra,</i> 4 Cal.4th at page 1085, when the evidence adduced in the declaratory relief action does not permit the court to eliminate the possibility that the insured's conduct falls within the coverage of the policy, \"the duty to defend is then <i>established,</i> absent additional evidence bearing on the issue.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>) If the insurer, having defeated the insured's motion for summary judgment, seeks to escape the defense duty altogether, it must present proof of the kind described in the preceding paragraph, i.e., evidence that the underlying claim cannot come within the policy coverage by virtue of the scope of the insuring clause or the breadth of an exclusion. In order to avoid any possibility that a refusal to defend may subject it to eventual liability for bad faith, the insurer is well advised to seek a judicial determination that it owes no defense. This it may do by means of a cross-motion for summary judgment in the declaratory relief action.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>(8) To eliminate the risk of inconsistent factual determinations that could prejudice the insured, a stay of the declaratory relief action pending resolution of the third party suit is appropriate when the coverage question turns on facts to be litigated in the underlying action. (See, e.g., <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1617</span></span>, 1627-1628 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App.2d 465, 471 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></span>].) For example, when the third party seeks damages on account of the insured's negligence, and the insurer seeks to avoid providing a defense by arguing that its insured harmed the third party by intentional conduct, the potential that the insurer's proof will prejudice its insured in the underlying litigation is obvious. This is the classic situation in which the declaratory relief action should be stayed. By contrast, when the coverage question is logically unrelated to the issues of consequence in the underlying case, the declaratory relief action may properly proceed to judgment. An illustration of this latter sort of case is found in <i>Flynt, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127477\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127477/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-flynt/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>. There, the question whether the owner had granted permission for the driver's use of the car was irrelevant to the third party's personal injury claim, and could properly be determined in the declaratory relief action independently of the timing of the third party suit.</p>\n<p>Travelers cites <i>Lassen Canyon Nursery</i> v. <i>Royal Ins. Co. of America</i> (9th Cir.1983) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427054\"><a href=\"/opinion/427054/lassen-canyon-nursery-inc-v-royal-insurance-company-of-america-formerly/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span> (<i>Lassen Canyon</i>) in support of its position that an insured must prove the existence of a \"reasonable potential for coverage,\" but that case does not help Travelers. <i>Lassen Canyon</i> noted that \"A thorough review of plaintiffs' complaint in the underlying action and other information available to the insurers about the nature of the action reveals no claim which could reasonably be construed as seeking recovery for property damage as defined in the policies.... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] An insurer ... will not be compelled to defend its insured when the potential for liability is so `tenuous and farfetched.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1018, quoting <i>Giddings</i> v. <i>Industrial Indemnity Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2140290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2140290/giddings-v-industrial-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>] [<i>Giddings</i>].) The reason the <i>Lassen Canyon</i> court labelled the potential for liability under the policy \"tenuous and farfetched\" is that the policy, covering claims for property damage, clearly did not cover claims for economic damages such as the federal antitrust claim advanced by the third party plaintiffs in the underlying action. (<i>Lassen Canyon, supra,</i> 720 F.2d at p. 1018.) In other words, the antitrust claim was not \"of the nature and kind covered by the policy.\" (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 274.) No reasonable construction of the claim could potentially bring it within the coverage of the policy. Thus, the insurer owed no defense duty. <i>Lassen Canyon</i> is inapposite to this case, in which the underlying suit <i>does</i> seek damages of the nature and kind covered by the policy. (See <i>AIU Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 842 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2610834\"><a href=\"/opinion/2610834/aiu-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, involved an attempt to secure a defense of federal court actions seeking damages for injury to intangible economic interests and property rights in a bank and in a private corporation. The <i>Giddings</i> court correctly held that the federal actions did not implicate the policies, which covered liability for property damage, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> variously defined as \"injury to or destruction of tangible property\" and \"(1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property ..., including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom, or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\" (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 216-217.) <i>Giddings,</i> too, is inapposite to the present case because a suit seeking recovery for injuries to intangible economic interests is not a suit \"of the nature and kind\" covered by a CGL policy, whereas environmental contamination alleged under CERCLA is \"property damage\" within the meaning of such a policy. (See <i>AIU Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> 51 Cal.3d at p. 842.)<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Travelers asserts that the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case is inconsistent with <i>Select Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164320/select-ins-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>] (<i>Select</i>). We disagree: <i>Select</i> is distinguishable because it involved the defense of lack of notice. In <i>Select</i> the insured, who had brought an unsuccessful antitrust suit against a third party in federal court, suffered a judgment on the third party's antitrust counterclaim. Four years after the filing of the counterclaim and several months after entry of judgment thereon, the insured notified his insurers and requested a defense and indemnity. The insurers declined and filed a declaratory relief action seeking a determination of their duties toward the insured. The trial court ruled that the insurers could not rely on the insured's failure to give notice as required under the policies, reasoning that once an insurer has denied coverage it waives any claim of noncompliance with the policy's notice provisions. The Court of Appeal reversed. It noted that in the usual case the insurer's denial of coverage demonstrates it would have acted no differently had it received timely notice under the policy, thus foreclosing reliance on the notice defense. (See <i>Clemmer</i> v. <i>Hartford Insurance Co.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382827\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382827/clemmer-v-hartford-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 883 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382827\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382827/clemmer-v-hartford-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, the court held that on the \"somewhat unique facts\" of <i>Select,</i> the insurers might be able to show prejudice from the insured's failure to give notice, since the delay prevented them from accepting the defense under a reservation of rights, attempting to settle the counterclaim, and pursuing the insured for the amount of the settlement. (See <i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Imperial Contracting Co.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167366\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167366/maryland-casualty-co-v-imperial-contracting-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span>]; <i>Select, supra,</i> 226 Cal. App.3d at pp. 637-638.) Because the insurers could not be held to have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> waived their notice defense, the <i>Select</i> court concluded that defense had to be adjudicated before the insured could be entitled to summary adjudication on the issue of the defense duty. (226 Cal. App.3d at p. 639.)</p>\n<p><i>Select</i> does not stand for the proposition that an insured bears the burden of negating each of the insurer's asserted reasons for denying a defense as a prerequisite to summary adjudication of the defense duty; indeed, <i>Select</i> places on the insurer the burden of proving prejudice from lack of timely notice and reaffirms the rule of <i>Gray.</i> (<i>Select, supra,</i> 226 Cal. App.3d at pp. 638-639.)</p>\n<p>Travelers also points to decisions observing that an insurer may, \"at its own risk,\" deny a defense based on its conclusion that coverage does not exist (the risk being that the insured will recover not only the costs of defense but also indemnity for a resulting settlement or adverse judgment in a bad faith action after the conclusion of the underlying suit). (See, e.g., <i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at p. 279; <i>Flynt, supra,</i> 17 Cal. App.3d at p. 548; <i>Saylin</i> v. <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra,</i> 179 Cal. App.3d at p. 263.) Travelers seems to contend that the existence of an eventual remedy for the insurer's bad faith denial of a defense somehow supports restriction of the duty to defend. The contention lacks merit. The scope of the duty is distinct from the remedies available to enforce it. Obviously, any denial of coverage and defense may be erroneous, and therefore run the risk of bad faith liability. A totally separate question is what showing the insurer must make in a declaratory relief action to establish the absence of a defense duty.</p>\n<p>(1b) Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we conclude that Montrose showed, prima facie, that the CERCLA complaint fell within the coverage of the various policies. Although the CERCLA complaint did not specify whether Montrose negligently or intentionally disposed of DDT process wastes \u0097 and therefore was, as the trial court observed, \"neutral\" on the question of coverage \u0097 its allegations sufficed to raise the possibility that Montrose would be liable for property damage covered by the policies. Extrinsic evidence adduced by the insurers did not eliminate that possibility, but merely placed in dispute whether Montrose's actions would eventually be determined not to constitute an occurrence or to fall within one or more of the exclusions contained in the policies. For instance, the fact that toxic discharges occurred over a lengthy period during which Montrose operated its Torrance facility does not, without more, establish that Montrose expected or intended the property damage that allegedly resulted.

And the fact that Montrose's regular business practices involved the disposal of DDT process wastes could not eliminate the possibility that at least some of the property damage might have resulted from accidental causes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISPOSITION</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed. As to American Motorists Insurance Company only, the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p>Lucas, C.J., Mosk, J., Arabian, J., Baxter, J., and George, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>KENNARD, J.</p>\n<p>I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to state my understanding of one aspect of the court's decision.</p>\n<p>When an insured calls upon a liability insurer to defend a third party action, the insurer as a general rule may not escape the burden of defense by obtaining a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend. Were the rule otherwise, the insured would be forced to defend simultaneously against both the insurer's declaratory relief action and the third party's liability action. Because the duty to defend turns on the potential for coverage, and because coverage frequently turns on factual issues to be litigated in the third party liability action, litigating the duty to defend in the declaratory relief action may prejudice the insured in the liability action. To prevent this form of prejudice, the insurer's action for declaratory relief may be either stayed (see <i>California Ins. Guarantee Assn.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1617</span></span>, 1626-1627 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></span>]).</p>\n<p>There are at least two exceptions to the general rule barring declaratory relief on the insurer's duty to defend. First, declaratory relief is available if the insurer can establish lack of coverage by means of facts that the insured does not dispute. Second, declaratory relief is available if the insurer's defense to coverage hinges on factual issues that are unrelated to the issues in the third party liability action. (See <i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2176448\"><a href=\"/opinion/2176448/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>].) In each of these situations, the duty to defend can be determined without forcing the insured to litigate issues that may arise in the third party action.</p>\n<p>The general rule and its exceptions shape the insurer's burden of proof on a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory relief action. An insurer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> moving for summary judgment must demonstrate an absence of coverage without engaging in litigation that could prejudice the insured's interests in the third party action. It can do so either by relying on undisputed facts or by adducing evidence of facts unrelated to the issues in the liability action. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies are disputed and may be litigated in the liability action, the court should deny summary judgment and stay or dismiss the declaratory relief action. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies are undisputed, the trial court should proceed to decide whether those facts establish lack of coverage, and grant or deny the motion for summary judgment accordingly. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies, although disputed, will not be litigated in the liability action, the trial court should proceed to consider the motion for summary judgment. If there are no triable issues of fact, the court may determine coverage, and hence the duty to defend, by summary judgment. If there are triable issues of fact, then the court should deny summary judgment and permit the declaratory relief action to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p>Of course, the insurer may have more than one defense to coverage. In that event, the trial court will need to consider each defense separately to decide whether it can be determined without prejudice to the insured and whether it is amenable to resolution by summary judgment or summary adjudication.</p>\n<p>With the understanding that the foregoing is consistent with the court's holding, I join the majority opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Defendants Canadian Universal Insurance Company, Inc.; Insurance Company of North America (INA); American Motorists Insurance Company (AMICO); the Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers); National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union); Centaur Insurance Company; and Admiral Insurance Company.</p>\n<p>[2]  INA refused to honor Montrose's request for independent counsel (see <i>San Diego Federal Credit Union</i> v. <i>Cumis Ins.

References to Travelers in this opinion include the other carriers, unless the context otherwise requires.\n</p>\n<p>AMICO separately seeks reversal of the determination that it owes a duty to defend Montrose on the ground that Montrose has not established it is a named insured under AMICO's policies. AMICO issued CGL policies to Stauffer Chemical Company, which undisputedly owned a 50 percent interest in Montrose throughout the relevant period. The policies covered Stauffer and its \"owned or controlled subsidiaries or affiliated companies or corporations now existing or hereafter created.\" Since the inception of this litigation, AMICO has disputed whether Montrose is a named insured under its policies. The trial court made no express finding on this issue, and the Court of Appeal did not address it despite briefing and argument and a petition for rehearing. AMICO separately petitioned for review in this court, raising the issue again. In opposition, Montrose invites us to hold that it is a named insured as a matter of law, given the plain meaning of the policies' language. We cannot properly do so. As an appellate tribunal, we are constrained not to make what is rightly a factual finding as to Montrose's status as a named insured. Instead, we shall remand this aspect of the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>For its part, Montrose argues that AMICO is collaterally estopped to relitigate the \"named insured\" issue due to a ruling in a related action. Since 1986 Montrose has litigated coverage issues under these same policies pertaining to Montrose's alleged liability arising from the \"Stringfellow site,\" a former state-approved waste disposal site near Riverside, California, and the \"Parr-Richmond site,\" a former processing facility near Richmond, California. (Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, et al. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1986, Nos. 594148, 597389), hereafter Canadian I.) After discovery in Canadian I, AMICO moved for summary adjudication, seeking a determination that Montrose is not a named insured under its policies; Montrose filed a responsive cross-motion. The trial court granted Montrose's motion and denied AMICO's, ruling that it \"shall be deemed established at the trial\" that \"Montrose is a `named insured' under [the AMICO policies].\" The parties disagree as to whether this ruling collaterally estops AMICO in the present action to challenge Montrose's status as a named insured. As the Court of Appeal did not address this argument, we will not reach it. On remand, the parties will have the opportunity to argue their respective positions on this issue.</p>\n<p>As AMICO joins in Travelers's brief raising other issues pertinent to determination of its duty to defend, our discussion of those issues applies as well to AMICO.</p>\n<p>[4]  Effective January 1, 1993, the California statute governing summary judgment practice, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, was amended. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1348, \u00a7 1.) The amendment eliminated the former requirement that a plaintiff moving for summary judgment refute each of the defendant's affirmative defenses, thereby bringing California practice in line with federal law. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (n)(1).) Because this case was decided under the former law, we need not and do not consider the impact of the amendment on the case before us.</p>\n<p>[5]  It might be argued that <i>Giddings</i> and <i>Lassen Canyon</i> are inconsistent with the <i>Gray</i> \"potential for coverage\" rule, inasmuch as, until the courts determined that the underlying claim was not of the nature and kind covered by the policy, there existed a theoretical possibility of coverage and, with it, a defense duty. But it is unclear whether an uncertainty regarding a purely <i>legal</i> question of policy interpretation is the sort of \"potential\" envisioned by <i>Gray.</i> The argument is not before us in the present case, and we therefore do not address it.</p>\n\n</div>",

The parties before us\u2014carriers who issued comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies and the pesticide manufacturer to which the policies were sold\u2014disagree on the proper use of extrinsic evidence in determining the scope of the defense duty and the nature of the parties\u2019 respective burdens on motions for summary adjudication of defense obligations. We conclude that evidence extrinsic to the underlying complaint can defeat as well as generate a defense duty, and that summary adjudication of the defense duty follows the same procedural rules as those applicable in any other type of litigation. Because the Court of Appeal correctly applied the law in this case, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">From 1947 to 1982, Montrose Chemical Corporation of California (Montrose) manufactured the pesticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT) at its facility in Torrance, California. During the 1960\u2019s conservationists began to raise serious concerns about the effect of DDT on the environment (see, e.g., Carson, The Silent Spring (1963)), and in 1972 the federal government prohibited its use within this country. Montrose continued to manufacture DDT for export at the Torrance facility until it closed the plant in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In 1990 the United States and the State of California sued Montrose in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 et seq.) (CERCLA). (United States, et al. v. Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, et al. (U.S. Dist. Ct. C.D.Cal.), 1990, No. CV 90-3122-AAH (JRx)).) The CERCLA action alleges that Montrose\u2019s operation of its Torrance facility caused environmental contamination that damaged land, water, and wildlife in the Los Angeles Harbor and neighboring waters. CERCLA imposes liability without fault on present and former owners of hazardous waste disposal sites, transporters of hazardous wastes, and those who arrange for the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a).) The complaint does not allege that Montrose intentionally caused the alleged contamination. Montrose is also named as a defendant in a cross-complaint filed by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. The cross-complaint alleges that Montrose\u2019s operations at the Torrance facility resulted in property damage over a lengthy period, for which Montrose should be held liable on theories of strict liability and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Montrose had purchased liability insurance from various carriers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to cover its operations at the Torrance facility from 1960 to 1986. The carriers issued to Montrose CGL policies in which they promised to defend it against \u201cany suit. . . seeking damages on account of bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false, or fraudulent.\u201d The carriers also agreed to indemnify Montrose for \u201cbodily injury or property damage . . . caused by an occurrence.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d was defined as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property which results during the policy period.\u201d \u201cOccurrence\u201d was defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in . . . property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Soon after the filing of the original complaint in the CERCLA action, Montrose gave notice to the carriers and requested that they provide it with a defense pursuant to their policies. Each carrier either denied coverage and declined to defend, or conditioned an offer of a defense on terms Montrose contends were inconsistent with applicable law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Montrose brought a declaratory relief action against the carriers, seeking a declaration that each owed a duty to defend in the federal action and cross-complaint. The carriers denied they owed a duty to defend; each asserted a number of affirmative defenses, including exclusions contained in the various policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Montrose moved for summary adjudication of the insurers\u2019 duty to defend. It argued that under <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168], it was entitled as a matter of law to have its insurers defend the underlying CERCLA action because the allegations of the complaint, along with the terms of the CGL policies, created a potential for liability, thus triggering a duty to defend. The insurers countered that Montrose had failed to establish that it was entitled to summary adjudication, and that extrinsic evidence revealed a triable issue of fact regarding whether a potential for liability existed, thus defeating Montrose\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of the insurers\u2019 defense duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The trial court denied Montrose\u2019s motion. It found that Montrose had failed to make a prima facie showing that the CERCLA action created a potential for coverage, reasoning that Montrose could not simply rely on the allegations of the third party\u2019s complaint, which were \u201cneutral\u201d regarding whether the alleged contamination was caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policies or by Montrose\u2019s regular business practices (which the trial court evidently viewed as outside the concept of \u201coccurrence\u201d). Absent an affirmative evidentiary showing that the contamination alleged in the CERCLA complaint resulted from an accident or occurrence, the trial court concluded, Montrose could not show a potential for coverage. The trial court also found that the insurers had adduced extrinsic evidence creating a triable issue of fact as to whether the CERCLA complaint alleged acts within the policies\u2019 coverage. According to the trial court, the evidence, if believed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>could support the inference that the alleged contamination resulted from Montrose\u2019s deliberate business management practices rather than from an accident or occurrence; therefore, summary adjudication was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Montrose sought relief by writ in the Court of Appeal. That court first summarily denied Montrose\u2019s petition and then, following our order retransferring the cause, granted relief. The Court of Appeal concluded that Montrose had made a prima facie showing of potential liability under the policies. While agreeing with the insurers that facts extrinsic to the underlying complaint may defeat as well as trigger a duty to defend, the Court of Appeal concluded that the insurers\u2019 extrinsic evidence did no more than put in dispute whether the acts alleged in the underlying complaint would eventually fall within one or more of the exceptions to the policies\u2019 coverage. Such a dispute, the court reasoned, could not defeat the potential for coverage that Montrose had established, and so could not eliminate the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We granted review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Recently we had occasion to restate the familiar principles governing adjudication of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.  In <em>Horace Mann Ins; Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792] <em>(Horace Mann), </em>we observed: \u201c[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. [supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 263 <em>(Gray)]. </em>As we said in <em>Gray, </em>\u2018the carrier must defend a suit which <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 275, italics in original.) Implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1081.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u201cThe determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.)\u201d <em>(Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1081.) As one Court of Appeal has put it, \u201c[f]or an insurer, the existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance, but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit. [Citation.] Hence, the duty \u2018may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 256, 263 [224 Cal.Rptr. 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The defense duty is a continuing one, arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded <em>(Lambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1072, 1077, 1079 [282 Cal.Rptr. 445, 811 P.2d 737]), or until it has been shown that there is <em>no </em>potential for coverage, as we demonstrate below. Imposition of an immediate duty to defend is necessary to afford the insured what it is entitled to: the full protection of a defense on its behalf. (See <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 359, 367 [165 Cal.Rptr. 799, 612 P.2d 889, 19 A.L.R.4th 75].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The insured\u2019s desire to secure the right to call on the insurer\u2019s superior resources for the defense of third party claims is, in all likelihood, typically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>as significant a motive for the purchase of insurance as is the wish to obtain indemnity for possible liability. As a consequence, California courts have been consistently solicitous of insureds\u2019 expectations on this score. (See, e.g., <em>Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 1076; <em>CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 598, 607 [222 Cal.Rptr. 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><em>Gray </em>made clear that facts known to the insurer and extrinsic to the third party complaint can generate a duty to defend, even though the face of the complaint does not reflect a potential for liability under the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276.) This is so because current pleading rules liberally allow amendment; the third party plaintiff cannot be the arbiter of coverage. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Whether extrinsic evidence can <em>defeat </em>the defense duty is a question that has elicited varying responses in the Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 538 [95 Cal.Rptr. 296] <em>(Flynt), </em>an automobile liability insurance policy made permission for use of the car a condition of coverage. While driving a car he had stolen, the insured\u2019s stepson was involved in an accident; his passenger brought a personal injury suit. In the insurer\u2019s declaratory relief action to determine the extent of its defense duty, the Court of Appeal concluded that, although the passenger\u2019s complaint did not allege the car was stolen, the insurer had no duty to defend. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 548.) The <em>Flynt </em>court reasoned: \u201cIf, as stated in <em>Gray, </em>an insurance company may not rely solely on the complaint filed by a third party against its insured to determine its potential liability and duty to defend under an insurance policy, if, in making this determination, it must consider facts it learns from its own insured and from its own investigation, then it follows it may determine from the total facts it learns from all sources that potential liability does not exist under the policy and refuse to defend the suit.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d 256, the third party complaint alleged that the insured committed tortious acts within the policy period. However, discovery revealed undisputedly that the insured had in fact done nothing concerning the third party while the policy was in force. The Court of Appeal noted that had the insurer known these facts at the outset of the litigation, it would have been justified in denying a defense. Citing <em>Flynt, supra, </em>the court held that the California Insurance Guarantee Association, on behalf of the insolvent insurer, had a duty to determine independently whether the third party claim was covered, and properly denied a defense on ascertaining the facts. <em>(Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 264.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Jiminez </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 437 [229 Cal.Rptr. 83], the claimant in the underlying action was injured on the insured\u2019s business premises. The insured sought a defense under his homeowners policy, although the policy expressly excluded business pursuits. The Court of Appeal concluded the insurer had no duty to defend, reasoning that no potential for liability under the policy existed inasmuch as the uncontradicted evidence showed the accident occurred on the business premises; amendment of the third party complaint to state a covered claim was, therefore, impossible. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The Court of Appeal in <em>CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at page 606 <em>(CNA), </em>stated a contrary rule in dictum. That dictum was cited approvingly in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1481, 1489 [272 Cal.Rptr. 7], and <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 944, 948 [266 Cal.Rptr. 250]. In none of these cases, however, was the principle that an insurer may not resort to extrinsic evidence to defeat a duty to defend embodied in the holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Moreover, the authority that <em>CNA, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at page 606, cites in support of its pronouncement on extrinsic evidence does not stand for the proposition advanced. In <em>Remmer </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Indem. Co. </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 84 [295 P.2d 19, 57 A.L.R.2d 1379], cited by <em>CNA, </em>the court observed, \u201c[The defense clause of the policy] required [the insurer] to defend the insured in any action alleging an injury under the policy \u2018even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.\u2019 Under such a clause it is the duty of the insurer to defend the insured when sued in any action where the facts alleged in the complaint support a recovery for an \u2018occurrence\u2019 covered by the policy, regardless of the fact that the insurer has knowledge that the injury is not in fact covered. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>[2d Cir. 1949] 178 F.2d 750; <em>Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Wis. </em>v. <em>Hendrix </em>[4th Cir. 1952] 199 F.2d 53 [41 A.L.R.2d 424].) But it is equally true that the insurer is not required to defend an action against the insured when the complaint in that action shows on its face that the injury complained of is not only not covered by, but is excluded from the policy. [Citation.] That is the present case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 90.) Thus, <em>Remmer, </em>like <em>CNA, </em>merely states in dictum that extrinsic evidence cannot defeat the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The source of the dicta in <em>CNA </em>and <em>Remmer </em>is <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1949) 178 F.2d 750 <em>(Lee). </em>The <em>Lee </em>court held that the validity of a claim of breach of the duty to defend \u201cdepends upon the meaning of the defendant\u2019s promise to \u2018defend . . . any suit against the Insured alleging injury, sickness, disease or destruction covered by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Policy . . . even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.\u2019 This language means that the insurer will defend the suit, if the injured party states a claim, which, qua claim, is for an injury \u2018covered\u2019 by the policy; it is the claim which determines the insurer\u2019s duty to defend; and it is irrelevant that the insurer may get information from the insured, or from any one else, which indicates, or even demonstrates, that the injury is not in fact \u2018covered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 751.) Although the latter sentence, taken in isolation, might seem to describe an indefeasible defense duty, closer examination of the opinion compels a different conclusion. Immediately following the language just quoted, the court said, \u201cThe insurer has promised to relieve the insured of the burden of satisfying the tribunal where the suit is tried, that the claim as pleaded is \u2018groundless.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 752.) The juxtaposition of the two sentences suggests that what the court was getting at was the well-established principle that the insurer may not decline to defend a suit merely because it is devoid of merit, but instead must assert appropriate defenses on its insured\u2019s behalf in the underlying action. Later in the opinion, the <em>Lee </em>court stated, \u201cIt follows that, if the plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the insured alleged facts which would have supported a recovery covered by the policy, it was the duty of the defendant to undertake the defense, <em>until it could confine the claim to a recovery that the policy did not cover.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 753; italics added.) <em>Lee </em>therefore contemplates that the insurer may terminate its defense obligation by proving that the underlying claim falls outside the scope of policy coverage, but not by demonstrating that the claim lacks merit, or might have merit only on some theory outside the scope of coverage. To read <em>Lee </em>as creating a rule of indefeasibility for the defense duty thus is to give it an unwarranted extension. The <em>CNA </em>dictum <em>(supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 606) does not accurately state the law in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The Court of Appeal in the present case followed the <em>Flynt </em>line of decisions, reasoning that \u201cneither logic, common sense, nor fair play supports a rule allowing only the insured to rely on extrinsic facts to determine the potential for coverage. It would be pointless, for example, to require an insurer to defend an action where undisputed facts developed early in the investigation conclusively showed, despite a contrary allegation in the complaint, that the underlying acts occurred on a date when the policy was not in effect or at a location concededly not covered by the policy. [Citations.] Similarly, where extrinsic evidence establishes that the ultimate question of coverage can be determined as a matter of law on undisputed facts, we see no reason to prevent an insurer from seeking summary adjudication that no potential for liability exists and thus that it has no duty to defend. [Citations.] We see the critical distinction as not whether extrinsic evidence may be considered, but whether such evidence presents undisputed facts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>conclusively eliminate a potential for liability.\u201d We concur in the reasoning of the Court of Appeal on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In holding that the trial court erroneously denied Montrose\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of the question whether the insurers owed a duty to defend the CERCLA action, the Court of Appeal stated: \u201c[OJnce the insured has established potential liability by reference to the factual allegations of the complaint, the terms of the policy, and any extrinsic evidence upon which the insured intends to rely, the insurer must assume its duty to defend unless and until it can conclusively refute that potential. Necessarily, an insurer will be required to defend a suit where the evidence suggests, but does not conclusively establish, that the loss is not covered. ... A carrier remains free to seek declaratory relief if undisputed facts conclusively show, as a matter of law, that there is no potential for liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Travelers criticizes the Court of Appeal\u2019s variously expressed references to \u201cpossibility\u201d of coverage as the test for whether the insurer owes a duty to defend its insured in the underlying suit. The correct test, Travelers insists, is whether there exists a <em>\u201creasonable </em>potential for coverage\u201d (italics added); this permits the insurer to engage in what Travelers calls a \u201cfactual balancing,\u201d taking into account disputed and undisputed facts, before making its determination whether to provide its insured with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Travelers\u2019s argument betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of <em>Gray, supra, </em>and of what is at issue in an adjudication of the defense duty. Because the policy at issue in <em>Gray </em>was ambiguous, and could be read either to exclude or to provide for coverage, we held that ordinary principles of insurance contract interpretation required it be construed in the insured\u2019s favor, according to his reasonable expectations. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 271-272; see also <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265, 1272 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) As a distinct, separate, and alternative basis for our decision, we recognized that the insured is entitled to a defense if the underlying complaint alleges the insured\u2019s liability for damages <em>potentially </em>covered under the policy, or if the complaint might be amended to give rise to a liability that would be covered under the policy. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 275-276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The alternative holding in <em>Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 263, establishes the rule that the insurer must defend in some lawsuits where liability under the policy ultimately fails to materialize; this is one reason why it is often said that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. (See, e.g., <em>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 272, 278 [142 Cal.Rptr. 681].) Any doubt as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. <em>(United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McGuire Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1560, 1567 [281 Cal.Rptr. 375]; <em>CNA, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 598, 605, fn. 1; <em>Eichler Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 532, 538 [47 Cal.Rptr. 843].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Thus, Travelers\u2019 advocacy of a \u201creasonable potential for coverage\u201d standard finds no support in <em>Gray. </em>Indeed, in that case we said that \u201cthe insurer need not defend if the third party complaint <em>can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.\u201d (Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276, fn. 15, italics added.) The quoted language cannot reasonably be understood to refer to anything beyond a bare \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201cpossibility\u201d of coverage as the trigger of a defense duty. Contrary to Travelers\u2019s interpretation, California courts have used the terms \u201cpossibility\u201d and \u201cpotential\u201d interchangeably, and we see no difference between them. (See <em>Fresno Economy Import Used Cars, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Travelers further argues that, although the Court of Appeal correctly recognized that facts extrinsic to the third party complaint may obviate the insurer\u2019s defense duty, it erred in reasoning that only <em>undisputed </em>extrinsic evidence can do so. The duty to defend is determined by reference to the policy, the complaint, and <em>all </em>facts known to the insurer from any source. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 276-277.) If this formulation is limited to undisputed facts, Travelers contends, then an insured can simply refuse to concede facts that take the underlying claim outside the scope of coverage, and thereby set itself up as arbiter of the defense duty. Travelers urges that such a rule effectively exempts determinations of the insurer\u2019s defense duty from conventional rules of contract interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Travelers again misconceives what is at issue in an action seeking declaratory relief on the issue'of the duty to defend. To prevail, the insured must prove the existence of a <em>potential for coverage, </em>while the insurer must establish <em>the absence of any such potential. </em>In other words, the insured need only show that the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it <em>cannot. </em>Facts merely tending to show that the claim is not covered, or may not be covered, but are insufficient to eliminate the possibility that resultant damages (or the nature of the action) will fall within the scope of coverage, therefore add no weight to the scales. Any seeming disparity in the respective burdens merely reflects the substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Travelers raises the specter of intransigent insureds being empowered to block summary judgment, to which insurers are otherwise entitled, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>mere assertions that coverage may exist. The prospect is apparent rather than real. This is because, as in summary judgment proceedings generally, an insured cannot manufacture a dispute on summary judgment, ipse dixit, by refusing to concede the truth of a fact without adducing some evidentiary support for its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">It is appropriate to recall at this point the procedural ramifications of rulings on motions for summary judgment in actions seeking a declaration of the existence or nonexistence of the duty to defend. When an insured successfully moves for summary judgment that the insurer owes a defense duty, the insurer\u2019s duty is clear. If an insurer successfully moves for summary judgment that it owes no duty to defend, the absence of a duty is clear. But an unfavorable ruling on the insured\u2019s motion does not establish the absence of a defense duty; it merely means that the question whether the insurer must defend is not susceptible of resolution by undisputed facts, but instead must go to trial. In the interim, presumably there continues to exist a potential for coverage and thus a duty to defend. As we said in <em>Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at page 1085, when the evidence adduced in the declaratory relief action does not permit the court to eliminate the possibility that the insured\u2019s conduct falls within the coverage of the policy, \u201cthe duty to defend is then <em>established, </em>absent additional evidence bearing on the issue.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the insurer, having defeated the insured\u2019s motion for summary judgment, seeks to escape the defense duty altogether, it must present proof of the kind described in the preceding paragraph, i.e., evidence that the underlying claim cannot come within the policy coverage by virtue of the scope of the insuring clause or the breadth of an exclusion. In order to avoid any possibility that a refusal to defend may subject it to eventual liability for bad faith, the insurer is well advised to seek a judicial determination that it owes no defense. This it may do by means of a cross-motion for summary judgment in the declaratory relief action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">To eliminate the risk of inconsistent factual determinations that could prejudice the insured, a stay of the declaratory relief action pending resolution of the third party suit is appropriate when the coverage question turns on facts to be litigated in the underlying action. (See, e.g., <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1627-1628 [283 Cal.Rptr. 104]; <em>General of America Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lilly </em>(1968) 258 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Cal.App.2d 465, 471 [65 Cal.Rptr. 750].) For example, when the third party seeks damages on account of the insured\u2019s negligence, and the insurer seeks to avoid providing a defense by arguing that its insured harmed the third party by intentional conduct, the potential that the insurer\u2019s proof will prejudice its insured in the underlying litigation is obvious. This is the classic situation in which the declaratory relief action should be stayed. By contrast, when the coverage question is logically unrelated to the issues of consequence in the underlying case, the declaratory relief action may properly proceed to judgment. An illustration of this latter sort of case is found in <em>Flynt, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 538. There, the question whether the owner had granted permission for the driver\u2019s use of the car was irrelevant to the third party\u2019s personal injury claim, and could properly be determined in the declaratory relief action independently of the timing of the third party suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Travelers cites <em>Lassen Canyon Nursery </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 720 F.2d 1016 <em>(Lassen </em>Canyon) in support of its position that an insured must prove the existence of a \u201creasonable potential for coverage,\u201d but that case does not help Travelers. <em>Lassen Canyon </em>noted that \u201cA thorough review of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the underlying action and other information available to the insurers about the nature of the action reveals no claim which could reasonably be construed as seeking recovery for property damage as defined in the policies. . . . [\u00b6]. . . [\u00b6] An insurer . . . will not be compelled to defend its insured when the potential for liability is so \u2018tenuous and farfetched.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1018, quoting <em>Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213, 220 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278] <em>[Giddings].) </em>The reason the <em>Lassen Canyon </em>court labelled the potential for liability under the policy \u201ctenuous and farfetched\u201d is that the policy, covering claims for property damage, clearly did not cover claims for economic damages such as the federal antitrust claim advanced by the third party plaintiffs in the underlying action. <em>(Lassen Canyon, supra, </em>720 F.2d at p. 1018.) In other words, the antitrust claim was not \u201cof the nature and kind covered by the policy.\u201d <em>(Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 274.) No reasonable construction of the claim could potentially bring it within the coverage of the policy. Thus, the insurer owed no defense duty. <em>Lassen Canyon </em>is inapposite to this case, in which the underlying suit <em>does </em>seek damages of the nature and kind covered by the policy. (See <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 842 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Likewise, <em>Giddings, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213, involved an attempt to secure a defense of federal court actions seeking damages for injury to intangible economic interests and property rights in a bank and in a private corporation. The <em>Giddings </em>court correctly held that the federal actions did not implicate the policies, which covered liability for property damage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>variously defined as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d and \u201c(1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property . . . , including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom, or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 216-217.) <em>Giddings, </em>too, is inapposite to the present case because a suit seeking recovery for injuries to intangible economic interests is not a suit \u201cof the nature and kind\u201d covered by a CGL policy, whereas environmental contamination alleged under CERCLA is \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of such a policy. (See <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 842.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Travelers asserts that the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case is inconsistent with <em>Select Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 631 [276 Cal.Rptr. 598] <em>(Select). </em>We disagree: <em>Select </em>is distinguishable because it involved the defense of lack of notice. In <em>Select </em>the insured, who had brought an unsuccessful antitrust suit against a third party in federal court, suffered a judgment on the third party\u2019s antitrust counterclaim. Four years after the filing of the counterclaim and several months after entry of judgment thereon, the insured notified his insurers and requested a defense and indemnity. The insurers declined and filed a declaratory relief action seeking a determination of their duties toward the insured. The trial court ruled that the insurers could not rely on the insured\u2019s failure to give notice as required under the policies, reasoning that once an insurer has denied coverage it waives any claim of noncompliance with the policy\u2019s notice provisions. The Court of Appeal reversed. It noted that in the usual case the insurer\u2019s denial of coverage demonstrates it would have acted no differently had it received timely notice under the policy, thus foreclosing reliance on the notice defense. (See <em>Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 865, 883 [151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 587 P.2d 1098].) However, the court held that on the \u201csomewhat unique facts\u201d of <em>Select, </em>the insurers might be able to show prejudice from the insured\u2019s failure to give notice, since the delay prevented them from accepting the defense under a reservation of rights, attempting to settle the counterclaim, and pursuing the insured for the amount of the settlement. (See <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Imperial Contracting Co. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 712, 720-721 [260 Cal.Rptr. 797]; <em>Select, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 637-638.) Because the insurers could not be held to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>waived their notice defense, the <em>Select </em>court concluded that defense had to be adjudicated before the insured could be entitled to summary adjudication on the issue of the defense duty. (226 Cal.App.3d at p. 639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><em>Select </em>does not stand for the proposition that an insured bears the burden of negating each of the insurer\u2019s asserted reasons for denying a defense as a prerequisite to summary adjudication of the defense duty; indeed, <em>Select </em>places on the insurer the burden of proving prejudice from lack of timely notice and reaffirms the rule of <em>Gray. (Select, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 638-639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Travelers also points to decisions observing that an insurer may, \u201cat its own risk,\u201d deny a defense based on its conclusion that coverage does not exist (the risk being that the insured will recover not only the costs of defense but also indemnity for a resulting settlement or adverse judgment in a bad faith action after the conclusion of the underlying suit). (See, e.g., <em>Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 279; <em>Flynt, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 548; <em>Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 263.) Travelers seems to contend that the existence of an eventual remedy for the insurer\u2019s bad faith denial of a defense somehow supports restriction of the duty to defend. The contention lacks merit. The scope of the duty is distinct from the remedies available to enforce it. Obviously, any denial of coverage and defense may be erroneous, and therefore run the risk of bad faith liability. A totally separate question is what showing the insurer must make in a declaratory relief action to establish the absence of a defense duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we conclude that Montrose showed, prima facie, that the CERCLA complaint fell within the coverage of the various policies. Although the CERCLA complaint did not specify whether Montrose negligently or intentionally disposed of DDT process wastes\u2014and therefore was, as the trial court observed, \u201cneutral\u201d on the question of coverage\u2014its allegations sufficed to raise the possibility that Montrose would be liable for property damage covered by the policies. Extrinsic evidence adduced by the insurers did not eliminate that possibility, but merely placed in dispute whether Montrose\u2019s actions would eventually be determined not to constitute an occurrence or to fall within one or more of the exclusions contained in the policies. For instance, the fact that toxic discharges occurred over a lengthy period during which Montrose operated its Torrance facility does not, without more, establish that Montrose expected or intended the property damage that allegedly resulted. <em>(City of Johnstown, N.Y. </em>v. <em>Bankers Standard Ins. </em>(2d Cir. 1989) 877 F.2d 1146, 1151; see <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 748 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] [test for \u201cexpected\u201d damage is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>insured knew or believed its conduct was substantially certain or highly likely to result in that kind of damage].) And the fact that Montrose\u2019s regular business practices involved the disposal of DDT process wastes could not eliminate the possibility that at least some of the property damage might have resulted from accidental causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed. As to American Motorists Insurance Company only, the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Lucas, C.

References to Travelers in this opinion include the other carriers, unless the context otherwise requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">AMICO separately seeks reversal of the determination that it owes a duty to defend Montrose on the ground that Montrose has not established it is a named insured under AMICO\u2019s policies. AMICO issued CGL policies to Stauffer Chemical Company, which undisputedly owned a 50 percent interest in Montrose throughout the relevant period. The policies covered Stauffer and its \u201cowned or controlled subsidiaries or affiliated companies or corporations now existing or hereafter created.\u201d Since the inception of this litigation, AMICO has disputed whether Montrose is a named insured under its policies. The trial court made no express finding on this issue, and the Court of Appeal did not address it despite briefing and argument and a petition for rehearing. AMICO separately petitioned for review in this court, raising the issue again. In opposition, Montrose invites us to hold that it is a named insured as a matter of law, given the plain meaning of the policies\u2019 language. We cannot properly do so. As an appellate tribunal, we are constrained not to make what is rightly a factual finding as to Montrose\u2019s status as a named insured. Instead, we shall remand this aspect of the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">For its part, Montrose argues that AMICO is collaterally estopped to relitigate the \u201cnamed insured\u201d issue due to a ruling in a related action. Since 1986 Montrose has litigated coverage issues under these same policies pertaining to Montrose\u2019s alleged liability arising from the \u201cStringfellow site,\u201d a former state-approved waste disposal site near Riverside, California, and the \u201cParr-Richmond site,\u201d a former processing facility near Richmond, California. (Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, et al. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1986, Nos. 594148, 597389), hereafter Canadian I.) After discovery in Canadian I, AMICO moved for summary adjudication, seeking a determination that Montrose is not a named insured under its policies; Montrose filed a responsive cross-motion. The trial court granted Montrose\u2019s motion and denied AMICO\u2019s, ruling that it \u201cshall be deemed established at the trial\u201d that \u201cMontrose is a \u2018named insured\u2019 under [the AMICO policies].\u201d The parties disagree as to whether this ruling collaterally estops AMICO</p>\n<p id=\"ANl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>in the present action to challenge Montrose\u2019s status as a named insured. As the Court of Appeal did not address this argument, we will not reach it. On remand, the parties will have the opportunity to argue their respective positions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">As AMICO joins in Travelers\u2019s brief raising other issues pertinent to determination of its duty to defend, our discussion of those issues applies as well to AMICO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Effective January 1, 1993, the California statute governing summary judgment practice, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, was amended. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1348, \u00a7 1.) The amendment eliminated the former requirement that a plaintiff moving for summary judgment refute each of the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses, thereby bringing California practice in line with federal law. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (n)(l).) Because this case was decided under the former law, we need not and do not consider the impact of the amendment on the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b337-5\">It might be argued that <em>Giddings </em>and <em>Lassen Canyon </em>are inconsistent with the <em>Gray </em>\u201cpotential for coverage\u201d rule, inasmuch as, until the courts determined that the underlying claim was not of the nature and kind covered by the policy, there existed a theoretical possibility of coverage and, with it, a defense duty. But it is unclear whether an uncertainty regarding a purely <em>legal </em>question of policy interpretation is the sort of \u201cpotential\u201d envisioned by <em>Gray. </em>The argument is not before us in the present case, and we therefore do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>",

I write separately to state my understanding of one aspect of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">When an insured calls upon a liability insurer to defend a third party action, the insurer as a general rule may not escape the burden of defense by obtaining a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend. Were the rule otherwise, the insured would be forced to defend simultaneously against both the insurer\u2019s declaratory relief action and the third party\u2019s liability action. Because the duty to defend turns on the potential for coverage, and because coverage frequently turns on factual issues to be litigated in the third party liability action, litigating the duty to defend in the declaratory relief action may prejudice the insured in the liability action. To prevent this form of prejudice, the insurer\u2019s action for declaratory relief may be either stayed (see <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1626-1627 [283 Cal.Rptr. 104]) or dismissed (see <em>General of America Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lilly </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 471 [65 Cal.Rptr. 750]).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">There are at least two exceptions to the general rule barring declaratory relief on the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. First, declaratory relief is available if the insurer can establish lack of coverage by means of facts that the insured does not dispute. Second, declaratory relief is available if the insurer\u2019s defense to coverage hinges on factual issues that are unrelated to the issues in the third party liability action. (See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 508, 527 [88 Cal.Rptr. 246].) In each of these situations, the duty to defend can be determined without forcing the insured to litigate issues that may arise in the third party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The general rule and its exceptions shape the insurer\u2019s burden of proof on a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory relief action. An insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>moving for summary judgment must demonstrate an absence of coverage without engaging in litigation that could prejudice the insured\u2019s interests in the third party action. It can do so either by relying on undisputed facts or by adducing evidence of facts unrelated to the issues in the liability action. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies are disputed and may be litigated in the liability action, the court should deny summary judgment and stay or dismiss the declaratory relief action. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies are undisputed, the trial court should proceed to decide whether those facts establish lack of coverage, and grant or deny the motion for summary judgment accordingly. If the trial court determines that the facts on which the insurer relies, although disputed, will not be litigated in the liability action, the trial court should proceed to consider the motion for summary judgment. If there are no triable issues of fact, the court may determine coverage, and hence the duty to defend, by summary judgment. If there are triable issues of fact, then the court should deny summary judgment and permit the declaratory relief action to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Of course, the insurer may have more than one defense to coverage. In that event, the trial court will need to consider each defense separately to decide whether it can be determined without prejudice to the insured and whether it is amenable to resolution by summary judgment or summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">With the understanding that the foregoing is consistent with the court\u2019s holding, I join the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>",

In the past several years, however, the highest courts of a rapidly growing number of states and the District of Columbia have reexamined the bases of the old common law rule and have uniformly determined that it no longer corresponds to the realities of the modern urban landlord-tenant relationship. Accordingly, each of these jurisdictions has discarded the old common law rule and has adopted an implied warranty of habitability for residential leases.<sup>[1]</sup> In June 1972, the California Court of Appeal reviewed this emerging out-of-state precedent in the case of <i>Hinson</i> v. <i>Delis</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Cal. App.3d 62</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">102 Cal. Rptr. 661</span>], and, persuaded by the reasoning of these decisions, held that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in California. We granted a hearing in the instant case, and a companion case,<sup>[2]</sup> to consider the <i>Hinson</i> decision and to determine whether the breach of such implied warranty may be raised as a defense by a tenant in an unlawful detainer action.</p>\n<p>For the reasons discussed below, we have determined that the <i>Hinson</i> court properly recognized a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in California, and we conclude that the breach of such warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*620</span> First, as the recent line of out-of-state cases comprehensively demonstrate, the factual and legal premises underlying the original common law rule in this area have long ceased to exist; continued adherence to the time-worn doctrine conflicts with the expectations and demands of the contemporary landlord-tenant relationship and with modern legal principles in analogous fields. To remain viable, the common law must reflect the realities of present day society; an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases must therefore be recognized.</p>\n<p>Second, we shall point out that the statutory \"repair and deduct\" provisions of Civil Code section 1941 et seq. do not preclude this development in the common law, for such enactments were never intended to be the exclusive remedy for tenants but have always been viewed as complementary to existing common law rights.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have concluded that a landlord's breach of this warranty of habitability may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Past California cases have established that a defendant in an unlawful detainer action may raise any affirmative defense which, if established, will preserve the tenant's possession of the premises. As we shall explain, a landlord's breach of a warranty of habitability directly relates to whether any rent is \"due and owing\" by the tenant; hence, such breach may be determinative of whether the landlord or tenant is entitled to possession of the premises upon nonpayment of rent. Accordingly, the tenant may properly raise the issue of warranty of habitability in an unlawful detainer action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The facts of the instant case.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin with a brief review of the facts of the instant case, which reveal a somewhat typical unlawful detainer action. On September 27, 1972, the landlord Jack Sumski commenced an unlawful detainer action in the San Francisco Small Claims Court seeking possession of the leased premises and $300 in back rent. The tenant admitted nonpayment of rent but defended the action on the ground that the landlord had failed to maintain the leased premises in a habitable condition. The small claims court awarded possession of the premises to the landlord and entered a money judgment for $225 against the tenant.</p>\n<p>The tenant then appealed the decision to the San Francisco Superior Court, where a de novo trial was held pursuant to section 117j of the Code of Civil Procedure. In support of his claim of uninhabitability, the tenant submitted a copy of an October 1972 inspection report of the San Francisco Department of Public Works disclosing some 80 housing code <span class=\"star-pagination\">*621</span> violations in the building in question, as well as an order of the department scheduling a condemnation hearing for January 19, 1973. In addition, in testimony at trial, petitioner and his roommate detailed a long list of serious defects in the leased premises which had not been repaired by the landlord after notice and which they claimed rendered the premises uninhabitable. Some of the more serious defects described by the tenants included (1) the collapse and nonrepair of the bathroom ceiling, (2) the continued presence of rats, mice, and cockroaches on the premises, (3) the lack of any heat in four of the apartment's rooms, (4) plumbing blockages, (5) exposed and faulty wiring, and (6) an illegally installed and dangerous stove.<sup>[3]</sup> The landlord apparently did not attempt to contest the presence of serious defects in the leased premises, but instead claimed that such defects afforded the tenant no defense in an unlawful detainer action.</p>\n<p>The superior court judge ultimately agreed with the landlord's contention, holding that the \"repair and deduct\" provisions of Civil Code section 1941 et seq. constituted the tenant's exclusive remedy under these circumstances.<sup>[4]</sup> Accordingly, the superior court entered judgment for the landlord, awarding him $225 and possession of the premises.</p>\n<p>The tenant thereafter sought certification and transfer of the case to the Court of Appeal (see Cal. Rules of Court, rules 62, 63), but the superior court denied the request. The tenant then sought a writ of mandate or prohibition from the Court of Appeal, contending that the trial court had erroneously failed to follow the <i>Hinson</i> decision. The Court of Appeal denied the writ summarily; the tenant thereafter sought a hearing in this court. (1)(See fn. 6.) Because of the statewide importance of the general issues presented (cf. <i>Treber</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1968) <span class=\"citation no-link\">68 Cal.2d 128</span>, 131 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal. Rptr. 330</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">436 P.2d 330</span>]; <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Cal.3d 509</span>, 515 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">96 Cal. Rptr. 584</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">487 P.2d 1224</span>]), we exercised <span class=\"star-pagination\">*622</span> our discretion and issued an alternative writ of mandate,<sup>[5]</sup> staying the execution of judgment conditioned upon the tenant's payment into court of all rent which had accrued since the superior court judgment and all future rent as it became due.<sup>[6]</sup> We now turn to the general legal issues presented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The transformation of the landlord-tenant relationship and developments in analogous areas of law compel the recognition of a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in California.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(2) At common law, the real estate lease developed in the field of real property law, not contract law. Under property law concepts, a lease was considered a conveyance or sale of the premises for a term of years, subject to the ancient doctrine of caveat emptor. Thus, under traditional common law rules, the landlord owed no duty to place leased premises in a habitable condition and no obligation to repair the premises. (3 Holdsworth, A History of English Law (5th ed. 1966) pp. 122-123; see, e.g., <i>Brewster</i> v. <i>DeFremery</i> (1867) <span class=\"citation no-link\">33 Cal. 341</span>, 345-346.) These original common law precepts perhaps suited the agrarianism of the early Middle Ages which was their matrix; at such time, the primary value of a lease lay in the land itself and whatever simple living structures may have been included in the leasehold were of secondary importance and were readily repairable by the typical \"jack-of-all-trades\" lessee farmer. Furthermore, because the law of property crystallized before the development of mutually dependent covenants in contract law, a lessee's covenant to pay rent was considered at common law as independent of the lessor's covenants. Thus even when a lessor expressly covenanted to make repairs, the lessor's breach <span class=\"star-pagination\">*623</span> did not justify the lessee's withholding of the rent. (See 6 Williston, Contracts (3d ed. 1962) \u00a7 890, pp. 580-589; <i>Arnold</i> v. <i>Krigbaum</i> (1915) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. 143</span>, 145 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">146 P. 423</span>].)</p>\n<p>In recent years, however, a growing number of courts have begun to re-examine these \"settled\" common law rules in light of contemporary conditions, and, after thorough analysis, all of these courts have discarded the traditional doctrine as incompatible with contemporary social conditions and modern legal values. This emerging line of decisions, along with a veritable flood of academic commentaries,<sup>[7]</sup> demonstrates the obsolescence of the traditional common law rule absolving a landlord of any duty to maintain leased premises in a habitable condition during the term of the lease.</p>\n<p>The recent decisions recognize initially that the geographic and economic conditions that characterized the agrarian lessor-lessee transaction have been entirely transformed in the modern urban landlord-tenant relationship. We have suggested that in the Middle Ages, and, indeed, until the urbanization of the industrial revolution, the land itself was by far the most important element of a lease transaction; this predominance explained the law's treatment of such leases as conveyances of interests in land. In today's urban residential leases, however, land as such plays no comparable role. The typical city dweller, who frequently leases an apartment several stories above the actual plot of land on which an apartment building rests, cannot realistically be viewed as acquiring an interest in land; rather, he has contracted for a place to live. As the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia observed in <i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span>, 1074 [138 App.D.C. 369]: \"When American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek `shelter' today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \u0097 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\" (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*624</span> In the past, California courts have increasingly recognized the largely contractual nature of contemporary lease agreements and have frequently analyzed such leases' terms pursuant to contractual principles. (See, e.g., <i>Medico-Dental etc. Co.</i> v. <i>Horton &amp; Converse</i> (1942) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Cal.2d 411</span>, 418-419 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">132 P.2d 457</span>]; <i>Groh</i> v. <i>Kover's Bull Pen, Inc.</i> (1963) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.2d 611</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">34 Cal. Rptr. 637</span>]. See generally Note, <i>The California Lease-Contract or Conveyance?</i> (1952) 4 Stan.L.Rev. 244.) Similarly, leading legal scholars in the field have long stressed the propriety of a more contractually oriented analysis of lease agreements. (1 American Law of Property (Casner ed. 1952) \u00a7 3.11, pp. 202-205; 2 Powell, Real Property (rev. ed. 1967) \u00b6 221 [1], p. 179; 6 Williston, Contracts (3d ed. 1962) \u00a7 890A, pp. 592-613.) Our holding in this case reflects our belief that the application of contract principles, including the mutual dependency of covenants, is particularly appropriate in dealing with residential leases of urban dwelling units.</p>\n<p>Modern urbanization has not only undermined the validity of utilizing general property concepts in analyzing landlord-tenant relations, but it has also significantly altered the factual setting directly relevant to the more specific duty of maintaining leased premises. As noted above, at the inception of the common law rule, any structure on the leased premises was likely to be of the most simple nature, easily inspected by the lessee to determine if it fit his needs, and easily repairable by the typically versatile tenant farmer. Contemporary urban housing and the contemporary urban tenant stand in marked contrast to this agrarian model.</p>\n<p>First, the increasing complexity of modern apartment buildings not only renders them much more difficult and expensive to repair than the living quarters of earlier days, but also makes adequate inspection of the premises by a prospective tenant a virtual impossibility; complex heating, electrical and plumbing systems are hidden from view, and the landlord, who has had experience with the building, is certainly in a much better position to discover and to cure dilapidations in the premises. Moreover, in a multiple-unit dwelling repair will frequently require access to equipment and areas solely in the control of the landlord.</p>\n<p>Second, unlike the multi-skilled lessee of old, today's city dweller generally has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work. Furthermore, whereas an agrarian lessee frequently remained on a single plot of land for his entire life, today's urban tenant is more mobile than ever; a tenant's limited tenure in a specific apartment will frequently not justify efforts at extensive repairs. Finally, the expense of needed repairs will often be outside the reach of many tenants for \"[l]ow and middle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*625</span> income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\" (<i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span>, 1078-1079 [138 App.D.C. 369].)</p>\n<p>In addition to these significant changes, urbanization and population growth have wrought an enormous transformation in the contemporary housing market, creating a scarcity of adequate low cost housing in virtually every urban setting.<sup>[8]</sup> This current state of the housing market is by no means unrelated to the common law duty to maintain habitable premises. For one thing, the severe shortage of low and moderate cost housing has left tenants with little bargaining power through which they might gain express warranties of habitability from landlords, and thus the mechanism of the \"free market\" no longer serves as a viable means for fairly allocating the duty to repair leased premises between landlord and tenant.<sup>[9]</sup> For another, the scarcity of adequate housing has limited further the adequacy of the tenant's right to inspect the premises; even when defects are apparent the low income tenant frequently has no realistic alternative but to accept such housing with the expectation that the landlord will make the necessary repairs. Finally, the shortage of available low cost housing has rendered inadequate the few remedies that common law courts previously have developed to ameliorate the harsh consequences of the traditional \"no duty to repair\" rule.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*626</span> These enormous factual changes in the landlord-tenant filed have been paralleled by equally dramatic changes in the prevailing legal doctrines governing commercial transactions. Whereas the traditional common law \"no duty to maintain or repair\" rule was steeped in the caveat emptor ethic of an earlier commercial era (see, e.g., <i>Nelson</i> v. <i>Meyers</i> (1928) <span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal. App. 66</span>, 75-76 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">270 P. 719</span>]), modern legal decisions have recognized that the consumer in an industrial society should be entitled to rely on the skill of the supplier to assure that goods and services are of adequate quality. In seeking to protect the reasonable expectations of consumers, judicial decisions, discarding the caveat emptor approach, have for some time implied a warranty of fitness and merchantability in the case of the sale of goods. (See <i>Klein</i> v. <i>Duchess Sandwich Co., Ltd.</i> (1939) <span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Cal.2d 272</span>, 276-283 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">93 P.2d 799</span>]; <i>Escola</i> v. <i>Coca Cola Bottling Co.</i> (1944) <span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal.2d 453</span>, 461-468 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">150 P.2d 436</span>] (Traynor, J., concurring.) <i>Peterson</i> v. <i>Lamb Rubber Co.</i> (1960) <span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal.2d 339</span>, 341-348 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Cal. Rptr. 863</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">353 P.2d 575</span>]. See generally Jaeger, <i>Warranties of Merchantability and Fitness for Use</i> (1962) 16 Rutgers L.Rev. 493.) In recent years, moreover, California courts have increasingly recognized the applicability of this implied warranty theory to real estate transactions; prior cases have found a warranty of fitness implied by law with respect to the construction of new housing units. (See <i>Aced</i> v. <i>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co.</i> (1961) <span class=\"citation no-link\">55 Cal.2d 573</span>, 582-583 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal. Rptr. 257</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">360 P.2d 897</span>]; cf. <i>Kriegler</i> v. <i>Eichler Homes, Inc.</i> (1969) <span class=\"citation no-link\">269 Cal. App.2d 224</span>, 227-229 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">74 Cal. Rptr. 749</span>]; <i>Avner</i> v. <i>Longridge Estates</i> (1969) <span class=\"citation no-link\">272 Cal. App.2d 607</span>, 609-615 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">77 Cal. Rptr. 633</span>].)<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*627</span> In most significant respects, the modern urban tenant is in the same position as any other normal consumer of goods. (See Note, <i>The Tenant as Consumer</i> (1971) 3 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 59.) Through a residential lease, a tenant seeks to purchase \"housing\" from his landlord for a specified period of time. The landlord \"sells\" housing, enjoying a much greater opportunity, incentive and capacity than a tenant to inspect and maintain the condition of his apartment building. A tenant may reasonably expect that the product he is purchasing is fit for the purpose for which it is obtained, that is, a living unit. Moreover, since a lease contract specifies a designated period of time during which the tenant has a right to inhabit the premises, the tenant may legitimately expect that the premises will be fit for such habitation for the duration of the term of the lease. It is just such reasonable expectations of consumers which the modern \"implied warranty\" decisions endow with formal, legal protection. (Cf. <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.2d 263</span>, 269-271 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal. Rptr. 104</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">419 P.2d 168</span>]. See generally Leff, <i>Contract as a Thing</i> (1970) 19 Am. U.L. Rev. 131.)</p>\n<p>Finally, an additional legal development casts significant light upon the continued vitality of the traditional common law rule. The past half century has brought the widespread enactment of comprehensive housing codes throughout the nation; in California, the Department of Housing and Community Development has established detailed, statewide housing regulations (see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 17921; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 1000-1090), and the Legislature has expressly authorized local entities to impose even more stringent regulations. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 17951.) These comprehensive housing codes affirm that, under contemporary conditions, public policy compels landlords to bear the primary responsibility for maintaining safe, clean and habitable housing in our state. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin declared with respect to that state's housing code: \"[T]he legislature has made a policy judgment \u0097 that it is socially (and politically) desirable to impose these duties on a property owner \u0097 which has rendered the old common law rule obsolete. To follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards.\" (<i>Pines</i> v. <i>Perssion</i> (1961) <span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Wis.2d 590</span>, 596 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">111 N.W.2d 409</span>, 412-413]; see <i>Buckner</i> v. <i>Azulai</i> (1967) 251 Cal. App.2d Supp. 1013, 1015 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">59 Cal. Rptr. 806</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">27 A.L.R.3d 920</span>].)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*628</span> Unquestionably these numerous factual and legal developments have completely eroded the foundations of the traditional common law rule. As noted earlier, the highest courts of seven of our sister states and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have discarded the traditional common law doctrine and have explicitly recognized an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the first to adopt this approach in 1961, and since 1969 the Supreme Courts of Hawaii, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Illinois, Iowa, and Massachusetts and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have followed this lead.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal decision in <i>Hinson</i> v. <i>Delis</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">26 Cal. App.3d 62</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">102 Cal. Rptr. 661</span>], was decided in the wake of this rapidly burgeoning, uniform trend of out-of-state decisions.<sup>[13]</sup> In <i>Hinson,</i> after a landlord had refused to repair a number of defects that had developed in the tenant's apartment \u0097 including a rotting bathroom floor, a defective toilet and an improperly fitting, drafty front door \u0097 the tenant withheld over two months rent, $200, and requested an inspection of the premises by a local housing inspector. The inspection confirmed the existence of a number of substantial housing code violations, and when the landlord received an official letter from the inspector he finally made the needed repairs. The landlord then demanded that the tenant pay the $200 that had been withheld, but, although the tenant ultimately agreed to resume paying her full rent as of the date of the completion of repairs, she continued to insist that she did not owe the full rent for the period when the premises had been in an unfit condition.</p>\n<p>The tenant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that her obligation to pay full rent was dependent upon the landlord's compliance \"with his duty to substantially obey the housing codes and make the premises habitable,\" and also seeking to enjoin the landlord from evicting her during the pendency of the action. The landlord agreed not to evict the plaintiff during the court proceedings, but the trial court concluded that although the landlord had violated several housing code regulations, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*629</span> plaintiff had no legal or equitable right to unilaterally withhold rent. Accordingly, the trial court entered a declaratory judgment that the tenant owed the landlord the full back rent.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal, however, relying heavily on the line of out-of-state decisions cited above, reversed the trial court's judgment and held that a warranty of habitability was implied by law in the tenant's lease, and that a landlord's breach of such warranty could justify a tenant's refusal to pay the full amount of the rent. The <i>Hinson</i> court emphasized, however, that \"the tenant is not absolved from all liability for rent, but remains liable for the reasonable rental value of the premises, as determined by the trial court, for such time as the premises were in violation of the housing codes.\" (26 Cal. App.3d at p. 70.) The court therefore remanded the case to the trial court to determine to what extent, if any, the landlord's alleged breach of an implied warranty of habitability excused the tenant's rental obligation.</p>\n<p>For the reasons discussed at length above, we believe that the traditional common law rule has outlived its usefulness; we agree with the <i>Hinson</i> court's determination that modern conditions compel the recognition of a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The \"repair and deduct\" remedy of section 1941 et seq. of the Civil Code was not intended as the exclusive remedy for tenants in this field and does not preclude the recognition of a common law warranty of habitability.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(3) The landlord in the present case suggests, however, that sections 1941 through 1942.1 of the Civil Code foreclose this court from adopting a common law implied waranty of habitability. In general, these sections place a statutory duty of maintenance and repair upon lessors of residential property and authorize a tenant, after giving reasonable notice of \"dilapidations\" to his landlord, either to quit the premises without further liability for rent or to repair the dilapidations himself and to deduct the cost of such repairs \u0097 up to one month's rent \u0097 from his rent. A 1970 amendment to section 1942 prohibits a tenant from using the \"repair and deduct\" option more often than \"once in any 12-month period.\" The landlord argues that the remedies provided the tenant in section 1942 were intended as the <i>exclusive</i> remedies for any failure of the landlord in his duty to repair. As noted earlier, the trial court in the instant case accepted the landlord's contention on this point, but we do not agree.</p>\n<p>Although past cases have held that the Legislature intended the remedies afforded by section 1942 to be the sole procedure for enforcing the statutory duty on landlords imposed by section 1941 (see, e.g., <i>Van Every</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*630</span> <i>Ogg</i> (1881) <span class=\"citation no-link\">59 Cal. 563</span>, 566; <i>Sieber</i> v. <i>Blanc</i> (1888) <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 Cal. 173</span>, 174 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">18 P. 260</span>]), no decision has suggested that the Legislature designed these statutory provisions to displace the common law in fixing the respective rights of landlord and tenant. On the contrary, the statutory remedies of section 1942 have traditionally been viewed as additional to, and complementary of, the tenant's common law rights.</p>\n<p>In the century since the statutes were first enacted, for example, California courts have evolved the \"constructive eviction\" doctrine as a common law remedy completely independent of this statutory framework; under the modern constructive eviction decisions, a tenant's right to terminate his lease has not been measured by the standards of sections 1941 or 1942, but by the developing standard that permits abandonment whenever a landlord's \"acts or omissions [render the premises] unfit for the purposes for which they were leased.\" (<i>Groh</i> v. <i>Kover's Bull Pen, Inc.</i> (1963) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.2d 611</span>, 614 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">34 Cal. Rptr. 637</span>]; <i>Giraud</i> v. <i>Milovich</i> (1938) <span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. App.2d 543</span>, 547 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">85 P.2d 182</span>].) Moreover, courts have permitted a tenant to utilize this common law constructive eviction doctrine, even when the tenant had apparently waived his rights under sections 1941 and 1942. (See <i>Buckner</i> v. <i>Azulai</i> (1967) 251 Cal. App.2d Supp. 1013, 1015 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">59 Cal. Rptr. 806</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">27 A.L.R.3d 920</span>]; cf. <i>Barkett</i> v. <i>Brucato</i> (1953) <span class=\"citation no-link\">122 Cal. App.2d 264</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">264 P.2d 978</span>]. See generally, Note, <i>Partial Constructive Eviction: The Common Law Answer in the Tenant's Struggle for Habitability</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Hastings L.J. 417</span>, 426.) These cases illustrate that the statutory framework of section 1941 et seq. has never been viewed as a curtailment of the growth of the common law in this field.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, the limited nature of the \"repair and deduct\" remedy, in itself, suggests that it was not designed to serve as an exclusive remedy for tenants in this area. As noted above, section 1942 only permits a tenant to expend up to one month's rent in making repairs, and now also provides that this self-help remedy can be invoked only once in any 12-month period. These limitations demonstrate that the Legislature framed the section only <span class=\"star-pagination\">*631</span> to encompass relatively minor dilapidations in leased premises. (See <i>Nelson</i> v. <i>Myers</i> (1928) <span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal. App. 66</span>, 75 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">270 P. 719</span>]; Loeb, <i>The Low-Income Tenant in California: A Study in Frustration</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Hastings L.J. 287</span>, 292.) As the facts of the instant case reveal, in the most serious instances of deterioration, when the costs of repair are at all significant, section 1942 does not provide, and could not have been designed as, a viable solution.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that Civil Code section 1941 et seq. do not preclude the development of new common law principles in this area, and we now hold that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in California.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>A tenant may raise a landlord's breach of an implied warranty of habitability as a defense in an unlawful detainer proceeding.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(4a) The landlord in a companion case (see fn. 2) contends, however, that even if we should uphold such a warranty, we could never permit a tenant to raise a landlord's breach of it in an unlawful detainer action. Relying initially on the fact that the <i>Hinson</i> decision itself involved a declaratory judgment action and not an unlawful detainer action, the landlord maintains that the trial court's refusal to permit the defense of a \"warranty of habitability\" in the instant case fully conforms with <i>Hinson.</i> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>In the first place, nothing in the <i>Hinson</i> decision supports such a distinction. Although the issue in <i>Hinson</i> arose in a declaratory judgment context, as we discuss below the decision itself endorses procedural protections which were specifically designed for unlawful detainer proceedings. (See <i>infra,</i> at pp. 636-637.) Moreover, a number of the out-of-state decisions on which the <i>Hinson</i> court based its opinion explicitly applied this warranty of habitability doctrine in an unlawful detainer context. (See <i>Marini</i> v. <i>Ireland</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549597\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549597/marini-v-ireland/\">56 N.J. 130</a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549597\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549597/marini-v-ireland/\">265 A.2d 526</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">40 A.L.R.3d 1356</span>]; <i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">138 App. D.C. 369</span>]; see also <i>Jack Spring, Inc.</i> v. <i>Little</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2178713\"><a href=\"/opinion/2178713/jack-spring-inc-v-little/\">50 Ill.2d 351</a></span> [280 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*632</span> N.E.2d 208]; <i>Rome</i> v. <i>Walker</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">38 Mich. App. 458</span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1996861\"><a href=\"/opinion/1996861/rome-v-walker/\">196 N.W.2d 850</a></span>].)</p>\n<p>Second, and more fundamentally, we have concluded that even apart from the <i>Hinson</i> decision, no legal doctrine bars a tenant from raising such a critical defense in an unlawful detainer action. We note initially that absolutely nothing in the statutory provisions governing unlawful detainer proceedings prohibits the assertion of any defense.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>The landlord contends, however, that to preserve the summary nature of the procedure, California courts have in the past limited the matters which may be raised by a defendant in an unlawful detainer action, and that these judicially created limits foreclose the tenant from utilizing a breach of warranty defense.</p>\n<p>The doctrine invoked by the landlord was most recently analyzed by our court in <i>Knowles</i> v. <i>Robinson</i> (1963) <span class=\"citation no-link\">60 Cal.2d 620</span>, 625 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">36 Cal. Rptr. 33</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">387 P.2d 833</span>]. In <i>Knowles</i> we explained: \"[W]here an objection is interposed in an action for unlawful detainer, no cross-complaint or counterclaim may survive. The remedy of unlawful detainer is designed to provide means by which the timely possession of premises which are wrongfully withheld may be secured to the person entitled thereto. The summary character of the action would be defeated <i>if,</i> by cross-complaint or counterclaim, <i>issues irrelevant to the right of immediate possession could be introduced.\"</i> (Italics added.) The court in <i>Lakeside Park Assn.</i> v. <i>Keithly</i> (1941) <span class=\"citation no-link\">43 Cal. App.2d 418</span>, 422 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">110 P.2d 1055</span>], similarly observed that: \"The reason for this rule is that the statute provides for the action of unlawful detainer as a summary proceeding, ... and that the <i>injecting of other issues extrinsic to the right of possession</i> may defeat the very purpose of the statute.\" (Italics added.)</p>\n<p>(5) The basic teaching of <i>Knowles, Lakeside,</i> and the entire line of cases these decisions reflect,<sup>[17]</sup> is that a defense normally permitted because it \"arises out of the subject matter\" of the original suit is generally excluded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*633</span> in an unlawful detainer action if such defense is extrinsic to the narrow issue of possession, which the unlawful detainer procedure seeks speedily to resolve.<sup>[18]</sup> Neither <i>Knowles, Lakeside</i> nor any other California decision, however, prohibits a tenant from interposing a defense which does directly relate to the issue of possession and which, if established, would result in the tenant's retention of the premises.<sup>[19]</sup> The thrust of the <i>Knowles'</i> line of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*634</span> cases is basically to prevent tenants from frustrating the summary statutory remedy through introduction of extraneous matter; the decisions accomplish this objective by confining the unlawful detainer action to issues directly relevant to the ultimate question of possession.</p>\n<p>(4b) The crucial issue in this case thus becomes whether a landlord's breach of a warranty of habitability directly relates to the issue of possession. Holding that such breach was irrelevant to the question of possession, early California cases refused to permit a defense that the landlord had breached a covenant to repair premises. (See, e.g., <i>Arnold</i> v. <i>Krigbaum</i> (1915) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. 143</span>, 145 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">146 P. 423</span>]; <i>Frasier</i> v. <i>Witt</i> (1923) <span class=\"citation no-link\">62 Cal. App. 309</span>, 315 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">217 P. 114</span>].) These decisions, however, rested primarily upon the ancient property doctrine of \"independent covenants,\" under which a tenant's obligation to pay rent was viewed as a continuing obligation which was not excused by the landlord's failure to fulfill any covenant of repair he may have assumed. As indicated earlier in this opinion, the entire foundation of the \"independent covenants\" doctrine rested on the central role played by land in the lease transaction of the Middle Ages; the doctrine simply reflected the fact that in those early times covenants regarding the maintenance of buildings were generally \"incidental\" to the furnishing of land, and did not go to the root of the consideration for the lease. In that setting, a landlord's breach of such an \"incidental\" covenant to repair was reasonably considered insufficient to justify the tenant's refusal to pay rent, the tenant's main obligation under the lease.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*635</span> The transformation which the residential lease has undergone since the Middle Ages, however, has completely eroded the underpinnings of the \"independent covenant\" rule. Today the habitability of the dwelling unit has become the very essence of the residential lease; the landlord can as materially frustrate the purpose of such a lease by permitting the premises to become uninhabitable as by withdrawing the use of a portion of the premises. (See fn. 20, <i>supra.</i>) Thus, in keeping with the contemporary trend to analyze urban residential leases under modern contractual principles, we now conclude that the tenant's duty to pay rent is \"mutually dependent\" upon the landlord's fulfillment of his implied warranty of habitability. (See <i>Medico-Dental etc. Co.</i> v. <i>Horton &amp; Converse</i> (1942) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Cal.2d 411</span>, 419-421 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">132 P.2d 457</span>].)<sup>[21]</sup> Such was essentially the holding of the Court of Appeal in <i>Hinson</i> v. <i>Delis</i> (26 Cal. App.3d at p. 71) as well as a number of the out-of-state cases which have recently adopted the implied warranty of habitability rule. (See pp. 631, 632, <i>ante.</i>) As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stated most recently: \"The old common law treatment of the lease as a property conveyance and the independent covenants rule which stems from this treatment have outlived their usefulness.\" (<i>Boston Housing Authority</i> v. <i>Hemingway</i> (1973) ___ Mass. ___ [<span class=\"citation no-link\">293 N.E.2d 831</span>, 841].)</p>\n<p>Once we recognize that the tenant's obligation to pay rent and the landlord's warranty of habitability are mutually dependent, it becomes clear that the landlord's breach of such warranty may be directly relevant to the issue of possession. If the tenant can prove such a breach by the landlord, he may demonstrate that his nonpayment of rent was justified and that no rent is in fact \"due and owing\" to the landlord. Under such circumstances, of course, the landlord would not be entitled to possession of the premises. (See <i>Skaggs</i> v. <i>Emerson</i> (1875) <span class=\"citation no-link\">50 Cal. 3</span>, 6; <i>Giraud</i> v. <i>Milovich</i> (1938) <span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. App.2d 543</span>, 547-549 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">85 P.2d 182</span>].)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*636</span> The landlord contends, however, that the recognition of such a defense will completely undermine the speedy procedure contemplated for unlawful detainer actions. In the first place, however, while the state does have a significant interest in preserving a speedy repossession remedy, that interest cannot justify the exclusion of matters which are essential to a just resolution of the question of possession at issue. As the Court of Appeal observed in <i>Abstract Investment Co.</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation no-link\">204 Cal. App.2d 242</span>, 249 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal. Rptr. 309</span>]: \"Certainly the interest in preserving the summary nature of an action cannot outweigh the interest of doing substantial justice. To hold the preservation of the summary proceeding of paramount importance would be analogous to the `tail wagging the dog.'\"</p>\n<p>Second, we believe the landlord's contention greatly exaggerates the detrimental effect of the recognition of this defense on the summary unlawful detainer procedure. As illustrated by the numerous California precedents cited and discussed above (see fn. 19), defendants in unlawful detainer actions have long been permitted to raise those affirmative defenses \u0097 both legal and equitable \u0097 that are directly relevant to the issue of possession; over the years, the unlawful detainer action has remained an efficient, summary procedure. We see no reason why the availability of a warranty of habitability defense should frustrate the summary procedure when the availability of these other defenses has not.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the landlord's dire forecast fades in the light of the host of recent out-of-state decisions which, in adopting a warranty of habitability, have explicitly permitted the issue to be raised in summary dispossession proceedings. (See p. 631, <i>ante.</i>) In addition, several \"model\" landlord-tenant codes, recently drafted under the auspices of highly regarded legal bodies, have also recommended the recognition of this defense in such summary actions. (See National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (1972) \u00a7 4.105; American Bar Foundation, Model Residential Landlord-Tenant Code (Tent. Draft 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 2-203(1), 3-210.) As these authorities recognize, this development accords with \"[t]he salutary trend toward determination of the rights and liabilities of litigants in one, rather than multiple proceedings....\" (<i>Jack Spring, Inc.</i> v. <i>Little</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2178713\"><a href=\"/opinion/2178713/jack-spring-inc-v-little/\">50 Ill.2d 351</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">280 N.E.2d 208</span>, 213].)</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the <i>Hinson</i> court indicated, sound procedural safeguards suffice to protect the landlord's economic interests without depriving the tenant of a meaningful opportunity to raise the breach of warranty issue. The <i>Hinson</i> court, elaborating on a procedural mechanism suggested by the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in the <i>Javins</i> opinion (428 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*637</span> F.2d at p. 1083, fn. 67), stated: \"If the tenant claims that all or a part of rent is not due because of defects in the premises, the trial court may, during the pendency of the action and at the request of either party, require the tenant to make the rental payments at the contract rate into court as they become due for as long as the tenant remains in possession. At the trial of the action the court can then determine how the rent paid into court should be distributed.\" (26 Cal. App.3d at p. 71.) Such a procedure can serve as a fair means of protection of landlords from potential abuses of the proposed warranty of habitability defense. (See National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (1972) \u00a7 4.105.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Conclusion.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We have concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \"bare living requirements\" must be maintained.<sup>[22]</sup> In most cases substantial compliance with those applicable building and housing code standards which materially affect health and safety will suffice to meet the landlord's obligations under the common law implied warranty of habitability we now recognize.<sup>[23]</sup> As the <i>Hinson</i> court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*638</span> observed: \"[m]inor housing code violations standing alone which do not affect habitability must be considered <i>de minimus</i> and will not entitle the tenant to reduction in rent....\" (26 Cal. App.3d at p. 70.)</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the tenant defended the unlawful detainer action on the grounds that the premises were not in a habitable condition; in support of this claim, as noted above, he presented a city housing inspection report detailing some 80 violations of local housing and building codes, including major defects in the building's plumbing and electrical facilities. At trial the tenant also testified that he had repeatedly informed the landlord of plumbing blockages, a collapsed bathroom ceiling, lack of heat in four rooms, exposed and faulty wiring and an illegally installed and dangerous stove, but that the landlord had failed to make any repairs within a reasonable period of time. Although this evidence of substantial defects in the premises was not controverted at trial, the court granted judgment for the landlord, on the theory that, whatever the condition of the premises, the tenant's exclusive remedy was provided by section 1941 et seq. of the Civil Code. As discussed above, that conclusion was erroneous and thus we must remand this case to the trial court so that it may determine whether the landlord has breached the implied warranty of habitability as defined in this opinion.</p>\n<p>If the trial court does find a breach of implied warranty, the court must then determine the extent of the damages flowing from this breach. Recent decisions have suggested that in these circumstances the \"tenant's damages shall be measured by the difference between the fair rental value of the premises if they had been as warranted and the fair rental value of the premises as they were during occupancy by the tenant in the unsafe or unsanitary condition.\" (<i>Mease</i> v. <i>Fox</i> (Iowa 1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">200 N.W.2d 791</span>, 797; <i>Boston Housing Authority</i> v. <i>Hemingway</i> (1973) ___ Mass. ___ [<span class=\"citation no-link\">293 N.E.2d 831</span>, 845]; <i>Academy Spires, Inc.</i> v. <i>Jones</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175278/academy-spires-inc-v-jones/\">108 N.J. Super. 395</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">261 A.2d 413</span>, 417].)</p>\n<p>We recognize that the ascertainment of appropriate damages in such cases will often be a difficult task, not susceptible of precise determination, but in this respect these cases do not differ significantly from a host of analogous situations, in both contract and tort law, in which damages cannot be computed with complete certainty. (See, e.g., <i>Shoemaker</i> v. <i>Acker</i> (1897) <span class=\"citation no-link\">116 Cal. 239</span>, 245 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">48 P. 62</span>]; <i>Donahue</i> v. <i>United Artists Corp.</i> (1969) <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal. App.3d 794</span>, 804 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">83 Cal. Rptr. 131</span>]; <i>Story Parchment</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*639</span> <i>Co.</i> v. <i>Paterson Co.</i> (1931) <span class=\"citation no-link\">282 U.S. 555</span>, 562-567 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">75 L.Ed. 544</span>, 548-551, <span class=\"citation no-link\">51 S.Ct. 248</span>].) In these situations, trial courts must do the best they can and use all available facts to approximate the fair and reasonable damages under all of the circumstances. (See McGregor, Damages (13th ed. 1972) \u00a7 258, p. 184; McCormick, Damages (1935) \u00a7 27, p. 101.)<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>In the instant case, the tenant has already quit the premises and thus the only matter to be determined on remand is the question of money damages owing to the landlord. In unlawful detainer actions generally, however, if the trial court determines that the landlord's breach of warranty is total, and that the tenant owes no rent whatsoever, the court should, of course, enter judgment for the tenant in the unlawful detainer action. If the court determines, however, that the damages from the breach of warranty justify only a partial reduction in rent, the tenant may maintain possession of the premises only if he pays that portion of the back rent that is owing, as directed by the trial court. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1174; cf. <i>Academy Spires, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">111 N.J. Super. 447</span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1935723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1935723/academy-spires-inc-v-brown/\">268 A.2d 556</a></span>, 562]; <i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span>, 1083 [138 App.D.C. 369].) If the tenant fails to pay such sum, the landlord is entitled to a judgment for possession. Finally, of course, if the trial court finds that the landlord has not breached the warranty of habitability, it should immediately enter judgment in favor of the landlord.</p>\n<p>In summary, we have concluded that the traditional common law rule which imposed no warranty of habitability in residential leases is a product of an earlier, land-oriented era, which bears no reasonable relation to the social or legal realities of the landlord-tenant relationship of today. The United States Supreme Court has observed that \"the body of private property law ..., more than almost any other branch of law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical.\" (<i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*640</span> (1960) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106022\"><a href=\"/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/\">362 U.S. 257</a></span>, 266 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106022\"><a href=\"/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/\">4 L.Ed.2d 697</a></span>, 705, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106022\"><a href=\"/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/\">80 S.Ct. 725</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">78 A.L.R.2d 233</span>]), and on previous occasions in recent years our own court has responded to the changes wrought by modern conditions by discarding outworn common law property doctrines. (See <i>Rowland</i> v. <i>Christian</i> (1968) <span class=\"citation no-link\">69 Cal.2d 108</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">70 Cal. Rptr. 97</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">443 P.2d 561</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">32 A.L.R.3d 496</span>].) In taking a similar step today, we do not exercise a novel prerogative, but merely follow the well-established duty of common law courts to reflect contemporary social values and ethics. As Justice Cardozo wrote in his celebrated essay \"The Growth of the Law\" chapter V, pages 136-137: \"A rule which in its origin was the creation of the courts themselves, and was supposed in the making to express the <i>mores</i> of the day, may be abrogated by courts when the <i>mores</i> have so changed that perpetuation of the rule would do violence to the social conscience.... This is not usurpation. It is not even innovation. It is the reservation for ourselves of the same power of creation that built up the common law through its exercise by the judges of the past.\"</p>\n<p>Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate the San Francisco Superior Court judgment entered in the case of Sumski v.

Consequently we have no occasion in the instant case to pass on the question of whether a lease of such premises constitutes an \"illegal contract\" (see <i>Shephard</i> v. <i>Lerner</i> (1960) <span class=\"citation no-link\">182 Cal. App.2d 746</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">6 Cal.

On the present record, the case at bar involves only an allegation that the landlord failed to maintain the leased premises in a habitable condition. (Cf. <i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span>, 1079 [138 App.D.C. 369].)</p>\n<p>[4]  The superior court judgment states: \"The court finds that defendant has not complied with sec. 1941 Civil Code et seq. and is not entitled to relief or withholding of rent by reason of such failure to comply.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  The propriety of relief by writ of mandate under these circumstances was recognized in <i>Schweiger</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">3 Cal.3d 507</span>, 517-518 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">90 Cal. Rptr. 729</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">476 P.2d 97</span>].</p>\n<p>[6]  Petitioner Green failed to make the requisite payments of rent into court, but instead quit the premises, allegedly because of continued deterioration of the dwelling; thus, our stay of execution is no longer in force. The landlord claims that this development has rendered the case moot, and he urges that the action be dismissed. Petitioner has properly pointed out, however, that the trial court judgment of $225 is still outstanding against him. Inasmuch as this outstanding adverse money judgment was rendered without consideration of the effects of a possible breach of an implied warranty of habitability, the present controversy is not moot.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, because of the general importance of the underlying warranty of habitability issue and the frequency with which this issue will arise, we believe that in any event we should resolve the question in the instant case. As we stated recently in <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Fales</i> (1973) <span class=\"citation no-link\">8 Cal.3d 712</span>, 715-716 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">106 Cal. Rptr. 21</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">505 P.2d 213</span>]: \"If an action involves a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur, a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue, even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot. [Citations.]\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The list of recent law review articles on this subject, uniformly advocating the adoption of an implied warranty of habitability as a more realistic approach to contemporary conditions, is virtually endless. (E.g., Lesar, <i>Landlord and Tenant Reform</i> (1969) 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1279; Quinn &amp; Phillips, <i>The Law of Landlord-Tenant: A Critical Evaluation of the Past With Guidelines for the Future</i> (1969) 38 Fordham L.Rev. 225; Schoskinski, <i>Remedies of the Indigent Tenant: Proposal for Change</i> (1966) 54 Geo.L.J. 519; Loeb, <i>Low Income Tenants in California: A Study in Frustration</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Hastings L.J. 287</span>; Moskovitz, <i>Rent Withholding and the Implied Warranty of Habitability</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Clearinghouse Rev. 49</span>; Note, <i>Repairing the Duty to Repair</i> (1971) 11 Santa Clara Law. 298.)</p>\n<p>[8]  Section 33250 of the Health and Safety Code, enacted in 1970, documents this condition in California. The section states: \"[The Legislature] finds and declares that there continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons and families of low income. This condition is contrary to the public interest and threatens the health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the people of this state.\"</p>\n<p>[9]  In light of this inequality of bargaining power, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in recently recognizing a warranty of habitability for residential leases, held that such warranty generally could not be waived by any provision in the lease or rental agreement. (See <i>Boston Housing Authority</i> v. <i>Hemingway</i> (1973) ___ Mass. ___ [<span class=\"citation no-link\">293 N.E.2d 831</span>, 843].) We agree that public policy requires that landlords generally not be permitted to use their superior bargaining power to negate the warranty of habitability rule. The Legislature has recently reached a similar conclusion with respect to tenants' rights under Civil Code section 1941 et seq. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1942.1.)</p>\n<p>[10]  Thus, for example, the doctrine of \"constructive eviction,\" which expanded the traditional \"covenant of quiet enjoyment\" from simply a guarantee of the tenant's possession of the premises (see <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Bernheimer</i> (N.Y. Com. Pleas 1875) <span class=\"citation no-link\">6 Daly 295</span>, 299; <i>Georgeous</i> v. <i>Lewis</i> (1912) <span class=\"citation no-link\">20 Cal. App. 255</span>, 258 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">128 P. 768</span>]) to a protection of his \"beneficial enjoyment\" of the premises through the maintenance of basic, necessary services (<i>Groh</i> v. <i>Kover's Bull Pen, Inc.</i> (1963) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.2d 611</span>, 614 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">34 Cal. Rptr. 637</span>]; <i>Sierad</i> v. <i>Lilly</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation no-link\">204 Cal. App.2d 770</span>, 773 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal. Rptr. 580</span>]), gives little help to the typical low income tenant today because to avail himself of the doctrine a tenant must vacate the premises. (See, e.g., <i>Veysey</i> v. <i>Moriyama</i> (1921) <span class=\"citation no-link\">184 Cal. 802</span>, 805-806 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">195 P. 662</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">20 A.L.R. 1363</span>]; <i>Lori, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Wolfe</i> (1948) <span class=\"citation no-link\">85 Cal. App.2d 54</span>, 65 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">192 P.2d 112</span>].) In the present housing market many tenants cannot find any alternative housing which they can afford, and thus this reform of the common law rules has in reality provided little comfort to most needy tenants. (See Loeb, <i>The Low-Income Tenant in California: A Study in Frustration</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">21 Hastings L.J. 287</span>, 304.)</p>\n<p>[11]  Indeed, even before the turn of the century, common law courts had recognized an implied warranty of habitability in leases of furnished rooms or furnished houses. In the seminal case of <i>Ingalls</i> v. <i>Hobbs</i> (1892) <span class=\"citation no-link\">156 Mass. 348</span>, 350 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">31 N.E. 286</span>]) the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained why the traditional no warranty of habitability rule did not apply to such rentals: \"[T]here are good reasons why a different rule should apply to one who hires a furnished room, or a furnished house.... Its fitness for immediate use ... is a far more important element entering into the contract than when there is a mere lease of real estate.... An important part of what the hirer pays for is the opportunity to enjoy it without delay, and without the expense of preparing it for use. It is very difficult, and often impossible, for one to determine on inspection whether the house and its appointments are fit for the use for which they are immediately wanted, and the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor,</i> which is ordinarily applicable to a lessee of real estate, would often work injustice if applied to cases of this kind. It would be unreasonable to hold, under such circumstances, that the landlord does not impliedly agree that what he is letting is a house suitable for occupation in its condition at the time.\"\n</p>\n<p>Recent cases have recognized that the rationale underlying the <i>Ingalls</i> court's adoption of an implied warranty of habitability in the rental of furnished dwellings is now applicable to urban residential leases generally. (See, e.g., <i>Boston Housing Authority</i> v. <i>Hemingway</i> (1973) ___ Mass. ___ [<span class=\"citation no-link\">293 N.E.2d 831</span>, 841]; <i>Javins</i> v. <i>First National Realty Corporation</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">428 F.2d 1071</span>, 1078 [138 App.D.C. 369].) Our decision today may be seen as a logical development of the common law principles embodied in the <i>Ingalls</i> decision.</p>\n<p>[12]  The cases are cited in fn. 1, <i>supra.</i> Moreover, lower courts in several additional states have also recently recognized the existence of an implied warranty of habitability. (See, e.g., <i>Amanuensis Ltd.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Misc.2d 15</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">318 N.Y.S.2d 11</span>]; <i>Quesenbury</i> v. <i>Patrick</i> (Colorado Cty.Ct. 1972) C.C.H. Pov.L.Rptr. \u00b6 15,803; <i>Glyco</i> v. <i>Schultz</i> (Ohio Mun.Ct. 1972) C.C.H. Pov.L.Rptr. \u00b6 16,608.)</p>\n<p>[13]  The <i>Hinson</i> decision was decided prior to the Illinois, Iowa, and Massachusetts decisions cited in footnote 1, but subsequent to all the other out-of-state authority.</p>\n<p>[14]  Two of the recent decisions of our sister states have reached similar conclusions under comparable circumstances. In <i>Jack Spring, Inc.</i> v. <i>Little</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2178713\"><a href=\"/opinion/2178713/jack-spring-inc-v-little/\">50 Ill.2d 351</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">280 N.E.2d 208</span>] the Illinois Supreme Court recognized a common law implied warranty of habitability in the face of an argument that a state statute which provided for rent withholding by welfare recipients was intended as the exclusive remedy in the area. And in <i>Boston Housing Authority</i> v. <i>Hemingway</i> (1973) ___ Mass. ___ [<span class=\"citation no-link\">293 N.E.2d 831</span>, 839-842 and fn. 10] the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court went even further, holding that a general statutory rent withholding procedure did not preclude the development of a common law implied warranty of habitability which would be available to a tenant even if he did not comply with the established statutory procedure. (See also <i>Amanuensis Ltd.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1971) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Misc.2d 15</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">318 N.Y.S.2d 11</span>].)</p>\n<p>[15]  In the recent case of <i>Academy Spires, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1935723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1935723/academy-spires-inc-v-brown/\">111 N.J. Super. 477</a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1935723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1935723/academy-spires-inc-v-brown/\">268 A.2d 556</a></span>] the landlord similarly claimed that a tenant's only remedies under the governing New Jersey \"warranty of habitability\" precedent, <i>Marini</i> v. <i>Ireland</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549597\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549597/marini-v-ireland/\">56 N.J. 130</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">265 A.2d 526</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">40 A.L.R.3d 1356</span>], were to \"repair and deduct\" or to abandon the premises. In rejecting this contention in a case involving the malfunctioning of a heating system, water pipes, elevators and an incinerator in a multi-storied apartment building, the court declared: \"Was the tenant required to make the repairs to this 400-unit complex as a prerequisite to availability of the relief given by <i>Marini?</i> If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, <i>Marini</i> has no meaning to tenants in multi-family dwellings who need the relief most. Obviously, few such tenants have the means to lay out the capital....\" (268 A.2d at p. 560.)</p>\n<p>[16]  Section 1170 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that in summary unlawful detainer proceedings \"the defendant may appear and <i>answer</i> or demur\" (italics added), and under section 431.30, an \"answer\" may contain \"[a] statement of any new matter constituting a defense\" but may not claim affirmative relief. Thus, nothing in the statutory scheme precludes a defendant from interposing an affirmative defense in an unlawful detainer proceeding.</p>\n<p>[17]  See, e.g., <i>Arnold</i> v. <i>Krigbaum</i> (1915) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. 143</span>, 145 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">146 P. 423</span>]; <i>Cheney</i> v. <i>Trauzettel</i> (1937) <span class=\"citation no-link\">9 Cal.2d 158</span>, 159 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">69 P.2d 832</span>]; <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Black</i> (1912) <span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal. App. 518</span>, 527-528 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">126 P. 512</span>]; <i>D'Amico</i> v. <i>Riedel</i> (1949) <span class=\"citation no-link\">95 Cal. App.2d 6</span>, 8 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">212 P.2d 52</span>].</p>\n<p>[18]  An exception to this rule has been recognized when the tenant has voluntarily surrendered possession of the premises before the trial of the unlawful detainer action. (See, e.g., <i>Servais</i> v. <i>Klein</i> (1931) <span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Cal. App. 26</span>, 36 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">296 P. 123</span>]; <i>Heller</i> v. <i>Melliday</i> (1943) <span class=\"citation no-link\">60 Cal. App.2d 689</span>, 697 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">141 P.2d 447</span>].) In such a case, the right to possession would no longer be at issue and thus the need for a speedy procedure, underlying the rule, would evaporate.</p>\n<p>[19]  Although several Court of Appeal decisions have suggested that the <i>Knowles</i> doctrine precludes the introduction of <i>all</i> affirmative defenses in unlawful detainer actions except for \"equitable\" defenses (see, e.g., <i>Union Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Chandler</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal. App.3d 716</span>, 721-722 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">84 Cal. Rptr. 756</span>]; <i>Rydell</i> v. <i>Beverly Hills P. &amp; P. Co.</i> (1927) <span class=\"citation no-link\">88 Cal. App. 216</span>, 219 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">262 P. 818</span>]; <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Black</i> (1912) <span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal. App. 518</span>, 527-528 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">126 P. 512</span>]), this characterization is inaccurate on two grounds. First, past cases have not permitted the interposition of any conceivable equitable defense, but have allowed only those defenses which, if established, would preclude the landlord from recovering possession of the property. Second, California decisions have at the same time permitted the introduction of \"legal\" defenses whenever such defenses, if proven, would have preserved possession in the tenant.\n</p>\n<p>Two cases aptly illustrate the first proposition. In <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Whyers</i> (1923) <span class=\"citation no-link\">64 Cal. App. 193</span>, 195 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">221 P. 387</span>], the court refused to permit a tenant to raise the \"equitable defense\" that the lease under which she held possession had been obtained by fraud, because even if the tenant established the invalidity of the lease, she would not have been entitled to retain possession but could only have rescinded and obtained damages. By contrast, in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Chely</i> (1872) <span class=\"citation no-link\">43 Cal. 299</span>, 305, a tenant was permitted to defend an unlawful detainer action on the ground that the landlord's lease was obtained by fraud, for the tenant had been in possession prior to the lease and thus by demonstrating its invalidity would have been entitled to retain possession. (See, e.g., <i>Schubert</i> v. <i>Lowe</i> (1924) <span class=\"citation no-link\">193 Cal. 291</span>, 295-296 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">223 P. 550</span>]; <i>Rishwain</i> v. <i>Smith</i> (1947) <span class=\"citation no-link\">77 Cal. App.2d 524</span>, 531-533 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">175 P.2d 555</span>]; <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Maier &amp; Zobelein Brewery</i> (1906) <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal. App. 653</span>, 657-658 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">84 P. 280</span>].)</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <i>Johnson</i> case also demonstrates that the rule permitting defenses that are relevant to the issue of possession is not limited to \"equitable\" defenses, but applies equally to \"legal\" defenses. In permitting the tenant to set up the defenses of fraud under the circumstances discussed above, the <i>Johnson</i> court specifically noted that such defense \"wherever set up, <i>is of legal and not of merely equitable cognizance</i> ....\" (Italics added.) (<i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Chely</i> (1872) <span class=\"citation no-link\">43 Cal. 299</span>, 305.) Similarly, the court in <i>Giraud</i> v. <i>Milovich</i> (1938) <span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. App.2d 543</span>, 547-549 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">85 P.2d 182</span>], permitted a tenant in an unlawful detainer action to raise the legal defense of \"partial eviction\" which excused the tenant's nonpayment of rent and precluded the landlord from obtaining possession of the premises. (See also <i>Skaggs</i> v. <i>Emerson</i> (1875) <span class=\"citation no-link\">50 Cal. 3</span>, 6; cf. <i>Arnold</i> v. <i>Krigbaum</i> (1915) <span class=\"citation no-link\">169 Cal. 143</span>, 146-147 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">146 P. 423</span>].) Indeed several of the early cases from which the so-called \"equitable defense\" exception emanated permitted defenses which might more appropriately be characterized as legal than equitable. (See, e.g., <i>Knight</i> v. <i>Black</i> (1912) <span class=\"citation no-link\">19 Cal. App. 518</span>, 526 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">126 P. 512</span>]; <i>Strom</i> v. <i>Union Oil Co.</i> (1948) <span class=\"citation no-link\">88 Cal. App.2d 78</span>, 81-85 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">198 P.2d 347</span>].)</p>\n<p>Two of the more recent unlawful detainer cases, <i>Abstract Investment Co.</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i> (1962) <span class=\"citation no-link\">204 Cal. App.2d 242</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal. Rptr. 309</span>] and <i>Schweiger</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation no-link\">3 Cal.3d 507</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">98 Cal. Rptr. 729</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">476 P.2d 97</span>], provide perhaps the clearest indication that the determination of whether a defense may be raised in such a proceeding does not turn on whether such defense is \"equitable\" or \"legal\" in nature, but rather upon whether the establishment of the defense will preclude the removal of the tenant from the premises. In <i>Abstract Investment</i> the court permitted a tenant to raise the landlord's alleged racially discriminatory motive as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. The court reasoned that if such discrimination were established, constitutional principles would bar the state from giving affirmative aid to the landlord's eviction efforts; hence, the proffered defense was directly relevant to whether the tenant could retain possession of the premises. Although the court noted the \"equitable\" considerations involved, the tenant's defense, in light of its constitutional basis, could at least equally be characterized as \"legal\" in nature.</p>\n<p>In <i>Schweiger,</i> following the lead of <i>Abstract Investment,</i> we upheld a tenant's defense to an unlawful detainer action on the ground that the landlord's attempt to evict a tenant was in retaliation for his exercise of his right to \"repair and deduct\" granted by Civil Code section 1941 et seq. Without specifically labelling this defense as \"legal\" or \"equitable,\" our court recognized that to prevent the emasculation of the \"repair and deduct\" remedy, we were compelled to permit such a defense in an unlawful detainer action. (3 Cal.3d at pp. 513-517.)</p>\n<p>[20]  The traditional \"independent covenant\" rule only applied to covenants, such as the covenant to repair buildings, which were \"collateral\" to the landlord's obligation to provide land to the tenant; because of the importance of land in early leases, the common law generally recognized that the tenant's obligation to pay rent was mutually dependent upon the landlord's fulfillment of his covenant to furnish the land. Thus, if the landlord deeded away even a small portion of the leased land, the common law considered this a \"partial actual eviction\" and relieved the tenant of his rental obligation. (See <i>Giraud</i> v. <i>Milovich</i> (1938) <span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. App.2d 543</span>, 547-549 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">85 P.2d 182</span>].)</p>\n<p>[21]  Our rejection of the \"independent covenant\" rule in this context was foreshadowed by the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Groh</i> v. <i>Kover's Bull Pen, Inc.</i> (1963) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.2d 611</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">34 Cal. Rptr. 637</span>]. In <i>Groh,</i> the landlord had covenanted to repair the roof of a store he rented, but failed to make the repairs. During the rainy season, severe leaks led the tenant to terminate the lease and sue for the return of his security deposit. The landlord claimed that his covenant to repair was \"independent\" of the tenant's covenant to pay rent, and thus that the tenant could only sue for damages but could not terminate the lease. The <i>Groh</i> court rejected this contention and found that the landlord's breach of his duty to repair did release the tenant from his obligations under the lease because \"the covenant undertaken by defendants to repair the roof goes to the very root of the consideration for the lease.\" (221 Cal. App.2d at p. 614.)</p>\n<p>[22]  The recent case of <i>Academy Spires, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1935723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1935723/academy-spires-inc-v-brown/\">111 N.J. Super. 477</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">268 A.2d 556</span>] gives a good indication of the general scope of the warranty of habitability. In that case, a tenant in a multi-story apartment building complained of a series of defects, including (1) the periodic failure to supply heat and water, (2) the malfunctioning of an incinerator, (3) the failure in hot water supply, (4) several leaks in the bathroom, (5) defective venetian blinds, (6) cracks in plaster walls, (7) unpainted condition of walls and (8) a nonfunctioning elevator. The <i>Academy Spires</i> court held: \"Some of these clearly go to bare living requirements. In a modern society one cannot be expected to live in a multi-storied apartment building without heat, hot water, garbage disposal or elevator service. Failure to supply such things is a breach of the implied covenant of habitability. Malfunction of venetian blinds, water leaks, wall cracks, lack of painting, at least of the magnitude presented here, go to what may be called `amenities.' Living with lack of painting, water leaks and defective venetian blinds may be unpleasant, aesthetically unsatisfying, but does not come within the category of uninhabitability. Such things will not be considered in diminution of the rent.\" (268 A.2d at p. 559.) (See also <i>Gillette</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Ill. App.3d 838</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">282 N.E.2d 149</span>] (warranty of habitability breached by failure to provide adequate bathing facilities).)</p>\n<p>[23]  We also believe that the standards of \"tenantability\" set out in Civil Code section 1941.1, though not strictly applicable in this context of their own force, may provide some helpful guidance in determining whether a landlord has satisfied the common law warranty of habitability.</p>\n<p>[24]  The case of <i>Academy Spires, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brown</i> (1970) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1935723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1935723/academy-spires-inc-v-brown/\">111 N.J. Super. 477</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">268 A.2d 556</span>, 561-562] demonstrates one reasonable response to the problem. The <i>Academy Spires</i> court, after fully acknowledging the difficulty of precisely determining damages resulting from a landlord's breach of an implied warranty of habitability, assessed damages by a \"percentage reduction of use\" approach, under which the court reduced the tenant's rental obligation by a percentage corresponding to the relative reduction of use of the leased premises caused by the landlord's breach. In applying this approach, the <i>Academy Spires</i> court carefully reviewed both the importance of the particular defects in the premises (including failure to supply heat, hot water, elevator service and a working incinerator) and the length of time such defects had existed (from one or two days to several weeks), and finally concluded that under all the circumstances \"the diminution in rent of 25% is a fair amount.\" (268 A.2d at p. 562.)

The action was brought against three primary insurers and numerous excess insurers, all of whose policies were in effect from 1966 to 1986.</p>\n<p>The three primary insurers \u0097 Insurance Company of North America (INA), American Home Assurance Company (AHA) and Commercial Union (CU) \u0097 moved for summary adjudication of the duty to defend. The trial court granted the motion, finding no duty to defend.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiff, American Cyanamid, appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Underlying Lawsuit</i></h2>\n<p>American Cyanamid is a research-based biotechnology and chemical company which since 1967 has developed, manufactured and sold \"chemical light products,\" e.g., chemical lightsticks, safety lights, light wands and other products used especially by the United States military.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*973</span> Chemical Device Corp. (CDC) is also in the business of manufacturing and selling chemical light products, but it has been in existence only since January 1986.</p>\n<p>In 1989 CDC filed suit in federal court against American Cyanamid seeking damages for CDC's loss of business resulting from American Cyanamid's monopolistic and anticompetitive conduct. CDC's complaint alleged two broad courses of conduct by American Cyanamid \u0097 one from 1967 to 1986 and the second from 1986 to the present. The pivotal date, 1986, was the date CDC itself entered the market for chemical light products.</p>\n<p>Because the insurance coverage action before us pertains only to insurance policies in effect before 1986, the allegations in the underlying lawsuit of most interest are those concerning American Cyanamid's pre-1986 conduct. In essence, the complaint alleges that American Cyanamid abused its patents in an effort to restrict competition and monopolize the market. Specifically, the complaint alleges that American Cyanamid developed certain chemical light products with funding from the United States Government pursuant to research and development contracts. These contracts required American Cyanamid to grant to the government a royalty-free license for its inventions and, further, to disclose in its patent applications, and in any resulting patents, that the patent was the result of a government-funded research and development contract. The purpose of this disclosure was to make competing suppliers aware of the government's royalty-free license and to enable the government to purchase chemical light products from those suppliers without being exposed to patent infringement claims.</p>\n<p>The complaint further alleges that from 1972 to 1986 American Cyanamid failed to make the requisite disclosure on its patent applications and thus failed to provide the government with a royalty-free license for its inventions. As a result, the government and potential competitors were led to believe that potential competitors would infringe American Cyanamid's patents if they manufactured and sold chemical light products to the government. American Cyanamid thereby created a monopoly in the government market for chemical light products.</p>\n<p>As to the post-1986 conduct, the complaint alleges that in February 1986 CDC submitted a bid to the United States Government's buying agent for the military services and thereby presented the first competition for the sale of chemical light products to the government. American Cyanamid thereupon engaged in a variety of activities designed to destroy the competition and perpetuate its monopoly over the market.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*974</span> Although CDC's complaint raises several legal theories, rulings by the federal district court upon motions by the parties narrowed the claims of CDC to (1) a claim for monopolization in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act and (2) state claims for theft of trade secrets, unfair competition and intentional interference with contractual relations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Insurance Policies</i></h2>\n<p>American Cyanamid was insured under eight separate primary policies during the period from 1966 to 1986. Although the liability policies are all worded differently, all provide coverage for damages the insured must pay for \"advertising injury,\" which is defined to include damage resulting from, among other things, unfair competition. The dispute here concerns timing: whether the pre-1986 policies provide coverage even though the injury to CDC did not occur (and indeed could not have occurred as CDC did not even exist) until after the policies had expired.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Insurance Coverage Action</i></h2>\n<p>In its action for declaratory relief American Cyanamid alleged that the pre-1986 insurance policies provided coverage for the CDC lawsuit because that lawsuit was based on \"acts or offenses occurring throughout the [policy] periods.\" It was American Cyanamid's position that coverage was triggered by the alleged anticompetitive conduct during the policy periods.</p>\n<p>In their motion for summary adjudication, the primary insurers did not directly raise the issue of when the insurance coverage was triggered. Instead, the insurers asserted that the \"offense\" of unfair competition could not have been committed before 1986 as CDC did not exist as a competitor.</p>\n<p>For purposes of the motion, American Cyanamid and the primary insurers stipulated to certain facts, including the following: \"CDC was incorporated on or about January 28, 1986. CDC makes no claim in the Underlying Litigation that it was either in business or otherwise in competition with plaintiff Cyanamid prior to January of 1986.\" The parties also stipulated that the sole issue to be adjudicated was the following: \"Does the fact that CDC did not exist as a competitor of American Cyanamid prior to January 28, 1986 preclude a duty to defend American Cyanamid in the underlying litigation under the advertising injury liability provisions of each of the primary policies at issue?\"</p>\n<p>The trial court concluded as follows: \"The Court finds that the fact that CDC did not exist as a competitor of American Cyanamid prior to January <span class=\"star-pagination\">*975</span> 28, 1986 precludes a duty on the part of the Primary Insurers to defend American Cyanamid in the underlying litigation under the advertising liability provision of the primary policies at issue. Absent the existence of a competitor there is no duty to defend an allegation of unfair competition.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>(1) There is no question that an insurer is not required to defend an action where undisputed facts conclusively show that the underlying conduct is not within the coverage of the policy. (<i>Montrose Chemical Corp.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158094/montrose-chemical-corp-v-superior-court/\">6 Cal.4th 287</a></span>, 298 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">24 Cal. Rptr.2d 467</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">861 P.2d 1153</span>].) In <i>Montrose,</i> the court reiterated that on a motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration of the nonexistence of a duty to defend, the insurer must establish the absence of any potential for coverage. (6 Cal.4th at p. 300.) If the parties dispute whether the insured's alleged misconduct is potentially within the policy coverage, and if the evidence submitted does not permit the court to eliminate either party's view, then factual issues exist precluding summary judgment in the insurer's favor. Indeed, \"the duty to defend is then <i>established,</i> absent additional evidence bearing on the issue.\" (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B.</i> (1993) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>, 1085 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal. Rptr.2d 210</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">846 P.2d 792</span>]; accord, <i>Montrose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158094/montrose-chemical-corp-v-superior-court/\">supra,</a></span></i> 6 Cal.4th at p. 301.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Nature of Underlying Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>At the outset, a brief discussion seems necessary on the nature of CDC's claim. As noted, CDC's complaint asserts, among other things, that American Cyanamid monopolized the market in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act and that American Cyanamid's course of conduct \"constitutes unfair competition within the meaning of Section 17200 et seq. of California's Business and Professions Code....\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th 1254</a></span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal. Rptr.2d 538</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">833 P.2d 545</span>], the Supreme Court construed the term \"unfair competition\" within a liability insurance policy and held that it does not refer to conduct prohibited by the Unfair Business Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.). The court drew a distinction between the common law tort of unfair competition and the statutory definition. (2 Cal.4th at pp. 1263-1264.) The court reasoned that the liability policy covers <i>damages</i> caused by unfair competition but damages are not available under the Unfair Business Practices Act. (2 Cal.4th at pp. 1265-1266.)</p>\n<p>It is clear, then, that CDC's claim for unfair competition, as pleaded, is not covered. CDC's complaint alleges a violation of the Unfair Business <span class=\"star-pagination\">*976</span> Practices Act. (2) However, it is by now a familiar principle that a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a <i>potential</i> for indemnity. (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.4th 1076</span>, 1081; <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1966) <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.2d 263</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal. Rptr. 104</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">419 P.2d 168</span>].) The insurer's duty is not measured by the technical legal cause of action pleaded in the underlying third party complaint but rather by the potential for liability under the policy's coverage as revealed by the facts alleged in the complaint or otherwise known to the insured. (<i>Gray, supra,</i> 65 Cal.2d at pp. 275-277; see also <i>CNA Casualty of California</i> v. <i>Seaboard Surety Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">176 Cal. App.3d 598</span>, 606-607 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">222 Cal. Rptr. 276</span>].)</p>\n<p>Thus, the question is whether the <i>facts</i> of the underlying lawsuit amount to a claim for \"unfair competition.\" That issue was not presented to the trial court, nor do we decide it here.<sup>[2]</sup> By stipulation, the parties obtained a ruling only on the question whether the nonexistence of CDC as a competitor precludes coverage. The parties agreed that if the trial court ruled against the insurers on that question further litigation would be necessary on whether there is a duty to defend. For purposes of our discussion, we will assume that the underlying facts constitute a claim for unfair competition.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Competitive Injury</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(3) Historically, the common law tort of \"unfair competition\" was a remedy for injury to a business rival. The cornerstone of the tort was misappropriation of another's commercial advantage: misappropriation by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*977</span> one business of the \"organization [or] expenditure of labor, skill, and money\" of another. (<i>Internat'l News Service</i> v. <i>Asso. Press</i> (1918) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99248\"><a href=\"/opinion/99248/internatl-news-serv-v-asso-press/\">248 U.S. 215</a></span>, 239 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">63 L.Ed. 211</span>, 221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99248\"><a href=\"/opinion/99248/internatl-news-serv-v-asso-press/\">39 S.Ct. 68</a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 A.L.R. 293</span>].) As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Bank of the West,</i> modern day statutes prohibiting unfair business practices expanded protection to consumers, not just business competitors. (<i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">2 Cal.4th 1254</span>, 1264; see also <i>Committee on Children's Television, Inc.</i> v. <i>General Foods Corp.</i> (1983) <span class=\"citation no-link\">35 Cal.3d 197</span>, 209 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">197 Cal. Rptr. 783</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">673 P.2d 660</span>]; <i>Barquis</i> v. <i>Merchants Collection Assn.</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">7 Cal.3d 94</span>, 110 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Cal. Rptr. 745</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">496 P.2d 817</span>]; <i>Stoiber</i> v. <i>Honeychuck</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Cal. App.3d 903</span>, 927 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">162 Cal. Rptr. 194</span>].) In <i>Bank of the West,</i> the Supreme Court held that a liability insurance policy analogous to the policies at issue here, covering damages for advertising injury arising from unfair competition, did not provide coverage for claims asserted by <i>consumers</i> in a lawsuit brought under state statute prohibiting unfair business practices. Coverage is available only when there is a claim of competitive injury. (2 Cal.4th at pp. 1262-1264; see also <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins. Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\">23 Cal. App.4th 1132</span>, 1151 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Cal. Rptr.2d 559</span>]; <i>Chatton</i> v. <i>National Union Fire Ins.

Rptr.2d 318</span>].)</p>\n<p>Indeed, courts of other jurisdictions have held there is no duty to defend an underlying lawsuit for unfair competition absent the element of competition or rivalry between the parties.

(9th Cir.1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">904 F.2d 710</span>.)</p>\n<p>In the present case the underlying lawsuit against American Cyanamid was brought by a competitor. CDC is not a member of the consuming public; CDC is a business rival of American Cyanamid. Thus, there is no dispute that the element of competitive injury exists. The trial court concluded, however, that there could be no coverage absent a competitive injury <i>during the policy period.</i> The court reasoned as follows: \"In the case at bar, the Court is asked to determine whether the primary insurers have a duty to defend under the advertising liability provisions of each of the primary policies. <i>Bank of the West</i> controls and the Court finds that there must be a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> competitor in existence before the duty to defend arises. [\u00b6] The Supreme Court relies upon <i>Barquis</i> v. <i>Merchants Collection Association</i> (1972) <span class=\"citation no-link\">7 Cal.3d 94</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Cal. Rptr. 745</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">496 P.2d 817</span>] for the proposition that competitive injury is an element of the common law tort of unfair competition (<i>Bank of the West,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th at 1264</a></span>). Under this common law concept, the scope of coverage for unfair competition requires a competitor. Logically, in order to have a competitive injury, there must be a competitor in existence. As thus restricted, the allegation of occurrences of unfair competition must be against an existing competitor. The allegations of the complaint are based upon Plaintiffs conduct prior to 1986. CDC did not exist during the period prior to January 1986. Therefore, the complaint cannot trigger the coverage of an advertising injury.\"</p>\n<p>(4a) The question before this court, then, is whether the coverage is triggered only when the injury to CDC took place \u0097 an event that occurred after the policies at issue here had already expired \u0097 or whether coverage is triggered by American Cyanamid's anticompetitive activities during the policy periods even though the injury did not occur until later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Trigger of Coverage</i>\n</h2>\n<p>(5) In questions of insurance coverage the court's initial focus must be upon the language of the policy itself, not upon \"general\" rules of coverage that are not necessarily responsive to the policy language. (<i>Garriott Crop Dusting Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 Cal. App.3d 783</span>, 790 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">270 Cal. Rptr. 678</span>]; <i>Harbor Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Central National Ins. Co.</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation no-link\">165 Cal. App.3d 1029</span>, 1034-1035 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">211 Cal. Rptr. 902</span>]; see also <i>American Star Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Insurance Co. of the West</i> (1991) <span class=\"citation no-link\">232 Cal. App.3d 1320</span>, 1325 [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2140079\"><a href=\"/opinion/2140079/american-star-ins-co-v-insurance-co-of-west/\">284 Cal. Rptr. 45</a></span>].)</p>\n<p>(4b) In the present case, the trial court mistakenly presumed that all of the policies are similarly worded and that they are triggered only by an <i>injury</i> during the policy period. In the words of the court, \"The policy at issue in <i>Bank of West</i> was substantially similar to the policies before this Court. It provided that it would pay, on behalf of the insured, all sums obligated to be paid as damages because of `advertising injury to which this insurance applies.' An advertising injury meant injury during the policy period from unfair competition.\"</p>\n<p>In fact, as will be seen in the following discussion, the policies at issue here do not contain identical language, and they do not all require an injury during the policy period in order to trigger coverage. The differing wording pertaining to the trigger of coverage puts the eight policies into four groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> (1) <i>Injury During the Policy Period</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Two of the policies (INA policy No. LAB 1263, July 31, 1971-Nov. 7, 1974, and CU policy No. CLCY 9883-002, Nov. 7, 1974-Jan. 1, 1976) cover personal injury, property damage, or advertising injury caused by an occurrence, and \"occurrence\" is defined as \"an injurious exposure to conditions, which results during the policy period, in personal injury, advertising injury or property damage....\" As to these two policies, the trial court correctly found the triggering event to be an injury during the policy period.</p>\n<p>(6) The general rule, articulated early on in <i>Remmer</i> v. <i>Glens Falls Indem. Co.</i> (1956) <span class=\"citation no-link\">140 Cal. App.2d 84</span> [<span class=\"citation no-link\">295 P.2d 19</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">57 A.L.R.2d 1379</span>], for construing policies covering an accident or occurrence which results in injury during the policy period is that coverage is triggered when the complaining party was actually damaged, not when the wrongful act was committed. (See also <i>Hallmark Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court</i> (1988) <span class=\"citation no-link\">201 Cal. App.3d 1014</span>, 1018-1019 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">247 Cal. Rptr. 638</span>]; <i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Longden</i> (1987) <span class=\"citation no-link\">197 Cal. App.3d 226</span>, 231 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">242 Cal. Rptr. 726</span>]; <i>Schrillo Co.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co.</i> (1986) <span class=\"citation no-link\">181 Cal. App.3d 766</span>, 773 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">226 Cal. Rptr. 717</span>].)</p>\n<p>Thus, for example, in <i>Schrillo Co.</i> v. <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">181 Cal. App.3d 766</span>, the insured manufactured power steering units from 1972 until early 1975. In May 1975 one of its units was installed in the truck of Larry Senger, and in 1977 Mr. Senger was injured when his truck crashed after a lockup of the power steering unit. Mr. Senger sued Schrillo claiming negligence in the manufacture of the power steering unit and Schrillo tendered the defense to Hartford, whose policy covered the period from May 1973 to April 1975. The trial court granted Hartford's motion for summary judgment, finding no duty to defend or indemnify as the injury occurred two years after the policy had expired. The Court of Appeal affirmed: \"In sum, the Hartford insurance policy evinces the mutual understanding and agreement of the parties that the risk taken by Hartford was limited to those instances in which the injuries claimed occurred during the policy period. In the case at bench, it is uncontradicted that the `accident' which was the basis for the Senger action `occurred' on May 15, 1977, over two years following the expiration of the Hartford policy coverage (April 17, 1975). Moreover, the power steering unit which allegedly caused the injuries was shipped on approximately May 21, 1975, over a month after the expiration of the Hartford policy coverage.\" (181 Cal. App.3d at p. 776.)</p>\n<p>(4c) In the present case, the INA and CU occurrence policies similarly provide coverage for advertising <i>injury</i> occurring during the policy period. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*980</span> The claimed injury to CDC could not have occurred during the policy periods (1971-1974 and 1974-1976) as CDC was not even in existence. We therefore conclude the trial court was correct in finding neither policy provided coverage and neither insurer had a duty to defend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(2) <i>Events During the Policy Period</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The foregoing general rule concerning the trigger of coverage of an occurrence policy is not applicable when the policy language differs from the language construed in <i>Remmer</i> and its progeny. (<i>Insurance Co. of North America</i> v. <i>Sam Harris Constr. Co.</i> (1978) <span class=\"citation no-link\">22 Cal.3d 409</span>, 411-412 [<span class=\"citation no-link\">149 Cal. Rptr. 292</span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">583 P.2d 1335</span>].) In <i>Sam Harris,</i> the policy applied to \"occurrences or accidents which happen during the policy period.\" Neither \"occurrences\" nor \"accidents\" was defined. The Supreme Court found this language distinguishable from the language in policies defining \"occurrence\" to mean an event causing injury during the policy period.</p>\n<p>In <i>Sam Harris,</i> the Supreme Court construed the term \"occurrence\" in accordance with its dictionary definition to mean simply something that happens during the policy period. In that case the insured had sold its airplane and cancelled its policy. Soon thereafter the plane crashed and the buyer sued the insured for negligent repairs. The Supreme Court held that the policy could refer to negligent repairs performed during the policy period even though the injury resulted later. Hence, the court concluded the insurer had a duty to defend the action.</p>\n<p>In the present case, one policy contains language similar to the language in <i>Sam Harris,</i> limiting coverage to \"occurrences which happen during the policy period\" but giving no definition of \"occurrence.\" (INA policy No. LAB 1263, June 30, 1966-July 31, 1971.) As to that policy we must conclude the policy could refer to American Cyanamid's anticompetitive conduct during the policy period even though the injury to CDC resulted later. Summary adjudication should not have been granted as to this policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(3) <i>Occurrence From an Offense</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Another policy is more problematic. It provides coverage for advertising injury \"to which policy applies arising from an occurrence within the policy territory.\" (INA policy Nos. ISL 1334, ISA 1225, June 30, 1982-June 30, 1983.) As in <i>Sam Harris, supra,</i> \"occurrence\" is not defined, nor is there any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*981</span> other temporal limitation on coverage. The occurrence need only take place \"within the policy territory.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Yet, unlike the policy construed above, the policy at issue here goes on to define \"advertising injury\" as \"<i>injury</i> or damage arising out of one or more of the following offenses: ... unfair competition....\" Reading the policy as a whole in its ordinary and popular sense, we uphold the trial court's interpretation of this language to mean that the triggering event is the injury, not the act. Accordingly, as no injury to CDC occurred during the policy period, the trial court correctly found no duty to defend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(4) <i>Offense Committed During Policy Period</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Four of the policies do not use the term \"occurrence\" in defining the temporal extent of their coverage; instead, these policies cover \"offenses committed ... during the policy period.\" (AHA policy No. GLA XXX-XX-XX, Jan. 1, 1976-June 30, 1976; AHA policy No. GLA XXX-XX-XX, June 30, 1976-June 30, 1980; INA policy Nos. ISL 1334, ISA 1225, June 30, 1980-June 30, 1982; INA policy No. ISL 1334, June 30, 1983-June 30, 1986.)<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Similar terminology was construed in <i>Harbor Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Central National Ins. Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">165 Cal. App.3d 1029</span>, where the court, as in <i>Sam Harris,</i> held the general rule regarding the trigger of coverage of an occurrence policy was not applicable to policies that did not even use the term occurrence. In <i>Harbor Ins. Co.</i> the insured had been sued for malicious prosecution. Two of its policies provided coverage for damages arising from the offenses of false arrest or malicious prosecution \"`if such offense is committed during the policy period.'\" (165 Cal. App.3d at p. 1035, italics omitted.) The Court of Appeal held that the offense of malicious prosecution is committed when the malicious action is instituted (not, as the trial court had found, when the action is favorably terminated.) (<i>Id.,</i> at pp. 1036-1037.) Hence, the court concluded there was no coverage under the policies which went into effect after the malicious action was filed and activated.</p>\n<p>In holding that the offense was committed when the malicious action was filed, the court recognized that the cause of action does not accrue until <span class=\"star-pagination\">*982</span> favorable termination, but the court reasoned that \"from both the tortfeasor's and the victim's standpoint the `offense' is `committed' upon initial prosecution of that action. At that point the tortfeasor has invoked the judicial process against the victim maliciously and without probable cause, and the victim has thereby suffered damage.\" (165 Cal. App.3d at p. 1037.)</p>\n<p>Here, under the policies in question, the offense is unfair competition. The question is when the offense was committed. The insurers rely primarily on <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th 1254</a></span>, in which the court noted that the common law tort of unfair competition, unlike a claim under a state statute prohibiting unfair business practices, requires a competitive injury. (<i>Id.,</i> at p. 1264.) The insurers extrapolate from this language that the tort of unfair competition is not complete until a competitor exists and has been injured; hence the \"offense\" could not have been committed here before 1986, before CDC came into existence.</p>\n<p>This reasoning is flawed for several reasons. First, <i>Bank of the West</i> did not involve the issue of trigger; the question there was whether coverage for \"unfair competition\" extended to claims of unfair business practices which had harmed consumers, not competitors. In the present case there is no question that it was a competitor who was allegedly harmed. Second, as to the four policies under discussion here, coverage is provided for \"offenses committed\" during the policy period. This language indicates that the triggering event is the act, not the injury. It is the offense that must be committed during the policy period in order to trigger coverage. There is nothing in the policies to require that the resulting injury must also occur or manifest itself during the policy period.</p>\n<p>Third, it does not logically follow from the requirement of a competitive injury that a competitor must be in existence at the same time that the anticompetitive conduct is committed. Preventing a competitor from entering the market is just as harmful as injuring the business of an established competitor. (7) Thus, one who was prepared to enter the market and intended to do so but was thwarted by another's monopolistic conduct qualifies as an injured party to sue under the Sherman Antitrust Act. (<i>Pennsylvania Sugar R. Co.</i> v. <i>American Sugar R. Co.</i> (2d Cir.1908) <span class=\"citation no-link\">166 Fed. 254</span>; see 4 Callman, Unfair Competition, Trademarks &amp; Monopolies (4th ed.) \u00a7 22.03; 54 Am.Jur.2d Monopolies, etc., \u00a7 298, p. 834.) Insofar as CDC's complaint alleges that American Cyanamid's anticompetitive practices before 1986 caused injury to CDC after it was formed in 1986, the complaint alleges that an \"offense\" was committed during the policy periods.</p>\n<p>(4d) It may well be that in the underlying action CDC will be unable to prove any actionable misconduct before 1986. In that case, American Cyanamid will have no liability before 1986 and will have no need for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*983</span> insurance coverage. The merits of the underlying lawsuit, however, are not before us. Instead, we are presented with a narrow question concerning the duty to defend, a duty which arises when the underlying action \"<i>potentially</i> seeks damage within the coverage of the policy.\" (<i>Gray</i> v. <i>Zurich Insurance Co., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\">65 Cal.2d 263</span>, 275, italics in original.) An insurer may owe a duty to defend even though no damages are ultimately awarded. (<i>Horace Mann Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Barbara B., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367552/horace-mann-ins-co-v-barbara-b/\">4 Cal.4th 1076</a></span>, 1081.)</p>\n<p>We conclude that American Cyanamid is potentially liable to CDC for offensive practices occurring even before 1986. Accordingly, we conclude the insurers on the four \"offenses committed\" policies may have a duty to defend. Summary adjudication was erroneous.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we affirm the trial court's ruling as to those three policies providing coverage for injury during the policy period (INA policy No. LAB 1263, July 31, 1971-Nov. 7, 1974; CU policy No. CLCY 9883-002, Nov. 7, 1974-Jan. 1, 1976; INA policy Nos. ISL 1334, ISA 1225, June 30, 1982-June 30, 1983). As to the remaining five policies, however (INA policy No. LAB 1263, June 30, 1966-July 31, 1971; AHA policy No. GLA XXX-XX-XX, Jan. 1, 1976-June 30, 1976; AHA policy No. GLA XXX-XX-XX, June 30, 1976-June 30, 1980; INA policy Nos. ISL 1334, ISA 1225, June 30, 1980-June 30, 1982; INA policy No. ISL 1334, June 30, 1983-June 30, 1986), summary adjudication was erroneous, and the judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded for further proceedings to determine the existence or nonexistence of a duty to defend under those five policies. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p>Newsom, Acting P.J., and Stein, J., concurred.</p>\n<p>A petition for a rehearing was denied January 9, 1995, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondents' petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 2, 1995.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  After the trial court ruled on the motion of the primary insurers, plaintiff dismissed the action as to the excess insurers. Plaintiff stipulated that in light of the trial court's ruling the primary insurers would be entitled to summary judgment, and plaintiff agreed to entry of judgment in favor of the primary insurers subject to plaintiff's right to appeal. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p>[2]  Nor do we decide whether American Cyanamid's alleged anticompetitive conduct, its failure to make the required disclosures in its patent applications and resulting patents, constitutes \"advertising activities\" so as to give rise to insurance coverage for advertising injury arising out of the insured's \"advertising activities.\" That issue was neither raised below nor argued on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  We note that in <i>Bank of the West</i> v. <i>Superior Court, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\">2 Cal.4th 1254</a></span>, the Supreme Court left unanswered the question whether coverage for unfair competition is narrowly limited to the common law tort of unfair competition or whether it extends to other anticompetitive business practices as long as damages are available.

The insured tendered the defense to its insurer; the latter refused to defend. We agree with the trial court that such a claim is not insured under a clause covering \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.\" In affirming the judgment, we acknowledge that a dictum in this court's opinion in <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. Co.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span>, 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, to the effect that a \"noninvasive interference with the use and enjoyment of property\" may constitute an \"other invasion\" under such an insuring clause, is erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTS</h2>\n<p>Joseph Caldwell and his wife sold 19 acres in the Chino Hills to Sterling Builders, Inc. Sterling intended to develop the property. In return for the land, the Caldwells received about $2.7 million, $500,000 in cash and the remainder in the form of a promissory note. About the same time, Sterling bought a six-acre parcel located adjacent to the parcel purchased from the Caldwells. Approximately two years later, the Caldwells and Sterling entered into a joint venture agreement to develop both parcels. The Caldwells received a 14.43 percent interest in the joint venture in return for forgiveness of $500,000 then due on the note.</p>\n<p>The following year, the Caldwells and Sterling entered into another agreement wherein the Caldwells reacquired the 19 acres in return for a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Concurrently, Robert Lintz, Sterling's sole shareholder, agreed to make specified payments to the Caldwells and to pay for property taxes, insurance, and certain other obligations incident to ownership of the property. The Caldwells later asserted that Sterling had requested this transfer to provide it with certain benefits, and that the parties had agreed the property would subsequently be transferred back to the joint venture.</p>\n<p>About 10 months thereafter, at Sterling's request, the Caldwells also took title to the adjacent six-acre parcel. At the same time, William Dohr, one of Sterling's officers, told the Caldwells that Sterling needed easements burdening the 19 acre parcel to enable Sterling to begin development of the parcels. In exchange for the easements, Dohr promised the Caldwells that Sterling would make a payment of $360,000, which was about to come due, and that the joint venture would, at some future time, take back title to the properties as previously agreed. In reliance on these promises, the Caldwells granted slope, landscaping, landscape maintenance, highway and road easements over their property.</p>\n<p>After another two years passed, and Sterling having failed to keep its promises, the Caldwells sued Sterling, Lintz, and Dohr (hereafter collectively Sterling, unless the context indicates otherwise), asserting inter alia that Sterling never intended to fulfill the obligations it assumed in return for granting the easement. The Caldwell's seventh cause of action alleged that in granting the easements, they had been deprived of valuable property rights.</p>\n<p>Sterling requested a defense of the Caldwells' suit from its commercial liability insurer, United National Insurance Company. Not having heard from United National, six months later Sterling filed the instant action for declaratory relief, breach of contract and bad faith. United National prevailed in a battle of cross-motions for summary adjudication on the duty to defend the issue, and the parties thereafter stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice of the balance of Sterling's causes of action, resulting in a final, appealable judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*699</span> DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Sterling contends that a clause in the personal injury endorsement of United National's policy defining \"personal injury\" to include \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" afforded at least the possibility of coverage of the underlying Caldwell action, and hence gave rise to a duty to defend.</p>\n<p>The typical situation for a \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" to occur is a trespass onto the claimant's real property. This court's decision in <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

There, the partners-policyholders' trespass was against the claimant's partnership rights; there was no invasion of the partnership's real property.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span>.)</p>\n<p>In <i>Fibreboard Corp. v.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, the court stated the \"other invasion\" language implicates a \"trespass paradigm.\" <i>Fibreboard</i> held that there was no invasion when the insured put asbestos products into the stream of commerce even if the products, when physically incorporated into various structures, ultimately resulted in displacing the claimants from their real property. The court reasoned that the policyholder was not guilty of a \"direct or indirect entry or intrusion ... upon the plaintiffs' lands.\" (<i>Ibid.;</i> also see <i>Nichols v. Great American Ins.

Here there are no allegations Sterling invaded or trespassed upon the Caldwell's servient estate. Rather, Sterling simply obtained one of the \"bundle of sticks\" constituting Caldwell's ownership <i>rights</i> in their land.</p>\n<p><i>Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v.

In <i>Stein-Brief,</i> a developer assumed a contractual duty to prevent a certain parcel from having more than a one-story house built on it. The developer allegedly breached the agreement, and allowed a two-story building to be built on the property. There was no coverage under the \"invasion\" language, because, although the claimant's property was affected, there was no actual occupation of his property. The court said the \"other invasion\" clause \"`connotes disruptions of the ability to actually occupy [the claimant's] property.'\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249141\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249141/stein-brief-group-v-home-indem-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>In its brief, Sterling derives comfort from two cases from other jurisdictions that have deviated from the requirement of a physical occupation of or incursion onto real property, <i>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co.</i> (1980) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></span>, 917 [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span>, 824] and <i>American States Ins.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span>, 825 and from this court's dictum in <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, which uncritically cited these cases. As we shall explain, the analyses contained in <i>Town of Goshen</i> and <i>American States</i> do not bear up under scrutiny. As a result the dictum in <i>General Accident</i> lacks foundation.</p>\n<p>In <i>Town of Goshen</i> a developer sued the insured, a local government, for delay in the approval of a subdivision application which had prevented him from using his property as planned. The town sought insurance coverage for the suit. The trial court ruled for the town, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed in a short <i>per curiam</i> decision which held that a \"regulatory obstacle to the use of real property\" could fall within the \"other invasion\" language. (<i>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mut. Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 424 A.2d at p. 824.) However, the opinion is particularly unenlightening; it fails to explain how the court reached its conclusion.</p>\n<p>The decision consists of 10 paragraphs. The first five paragraphs merely relate the facts and quote the relevant contract terms: The town had passed certain regulations which created \"economic hardships\" that destroyed the viability of a developer's project, the town was being sued, and it had an insurance policy which provided personal injury coverage. (<i>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mut. Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 424 A.2d at p. 823.) The sixth paragraph sets up the issue as framed by the insurer, i.e., whether the absence of any invasion upon the land precluded coverage, and juxtaposed that issue with the trial court's ruling finding coverage. The opinion does not explain how nor why the trial court concluded there was coverage.</p>\n<p>The seventh paragraph of the opinion consists of three sentences and contains the actual ruling. The first sentence is a topic sentence giving the court's conclusion, stating it was rejecting the insurer's argument: \"We cannot accept [the insurer's] argument that an appreciable and tangible interference with the physical property itself is necessary to constitute an `invasion of the right of private occupancy.'\" (<i>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mut. Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 424 A.2d at p. 824.)</p>\n<p>The entire weight of the court's reasoning is carried by the second sentence of the seventh paragraph. But instead of giving a reason why it could not accept the insurer's argument, the court relies on its raw authority: \"We are of the opinion that the allegations in the complaint would constitute the required `invasion of the right of private occupancy.'\" (<i>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mut. Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 424 A.2d at p. 824.) That is the sum total of the court's \"analysis.\" The third sentence merely reiterates the third party allegations, without any attempt to connect the language of the policy to those allegations. Nor do the final three paragraphs, which hold that a decision in favor of coverage was not precluded by the developer having based its action against the city on a federal civil rights statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), explain why a decision in favor of coverage was merited in the first place.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*701</span> In sum, the <i>Town of Goshen</i> opinion never explains why land use regulations could constitute an invasion of real property. The court merely put the words \"we are of the opinion\" in front of its conclusion.</p>\n<p>The federal district court's opinion in <i>American States</i> has more to commend it, though it still fails to demonstrate that the other invasion of the right of private occupancy can encompass a noninvasive interference with legal rights. The underlying case in <i>American States</i> involved misrepresentations relating to real property transactions. The claimants, a group of mobile home purchasers, claimed they had been duped into believing they would own the land beneath their homes. When they found that they did not, they sued the seller. Most of the opinion consists of a discussion of whether the claim against the seller could fall within the \"advertising injury\" coverage of the policy and held that it did.</p>\n<p>As an additional holding the <i>American States</i> court concluded the phrase \"other invasion\" was ambiguous. Specifically, the court noted that the insurance policy had not expressly limited the meaning of \"invasion\" to \"physical\" invasions. (<i>American States Ins. Co. v. Canyon <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Creek,</span> supra</span>,</i> 786 F.Supp. at p. 828.) The court then reasoned that, because it had to resolve any ambiguity against the insurer, the clause provided coverage for the claim. (See <i>American States Ins. Co. v. Canyon <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Creek,</span> supra</span>,</i> 786 F.Supp. at p. 829.) However, for a contract to be ambiguous it must be susceptible to at least two different reasonable interpretations (see, e.g., <i>Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. Superior Court</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></span>, 848, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span>); the <i>American States</i> court failed to identify what those reasonable interpretations were, other than to intimate there could be both physical and nonphysical invasions of real property, thus, as in <i>Town of Goshen,</i> adopting the concept of \"nonphysical invasion\" by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p>Significantly, <i>American States,</i> which was based on California law, (<i>American States Ins. Co. v. Canyon <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Creek,</span> supra</span>,</i> 786 F.Supp. at p. 825) was decided prior to our Supreme Court's watershed insurance law decision in <i>Bank of the West v. Superior Court</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(<i>Id.</i> at pp. 1264-1265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Contract terms are not ambiguous in a vacuum; they must be examined in context. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607512/bank-of-the-west-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Even when there is an ambiguity in an insurance contract, the ambiguous term must still comport with a policyholder's \"objectively reasonable expectations.\" (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>\n<p>In <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, although not necessary to our decision, we stated that \"[t]hese claims [i.e. claims under the `wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion' clause of the personal injury endorsement] have included ... noninvasive interferences with the use and enjoyment of property.\" (<i>Id,</i> at pp. 103-104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>.) It is true that the cases we cited in support of this statement (<i>Town of Goshen</i> and <i>American States) did</i> include noninvasive interferences or nonphysical invasions. However, to the extent that our statement indicated approval of the holdings in these cases, we were mistaken.</p>\n<p>\"Invasion\" denotes an incursion, not a misrepresentation. The Oxford English dictionary provides these variations of meaning to the word \"invasion\": \"1. a. The action of invading a country or territory as an enemy; an entrance or incursion with armed force; a hostile inroad\"; \"b. [figuratively] A harmful incursion of any kind, e.g. of the sea, of disease, moral evil, etc.\"; \"c. [in pathology] The spreading of pathogenic microorganisms or malignant cells that are already in the body to new sites\"; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*702</span> \"2. Infringement by intrusion; encroachment upon the property, rights, privacy, etc[.] of any one. Esp. in phr. <i>invasion of privacy</i>\"; \"3. Assault, attack (upon a person, etc.)\"; and \"4. [in ecology] The spread of a plant or animal population into an area formerly free of the species concerned.\" (VIII Oxford Eng. Diet. (2d ed.1989) at p. 37, original italics.) Even the most figurative of these definitions (\"harmful incursion\") still entails the idea of going <i>into</i> something, rather than obtaining that something by fraud, or, as in <i>American States,</i> tricking people into believing they had a right they never had in the first place.</p>\n<p>The Caldwells were not damaged by a trespass (see <i>Fibreboard</i>), an entry or an intrusion (<i>Wilmington Liquid Bulk Terminals</i>), nor as a result of an actual occupation of real property (<i>Stein-Brief).</i> Their damages were caused by Sterling fraudulently obtaining an interest <i>in</i> the real property. These facts constitute a transaction, not a trespass.</p>\n<p>There being no coverage under the terms of the insurance policy, our conclusion stands regardless of whether the underlying claim was pleaded in contract or tort. (Cf. <i>Vandenberg v. Superior Court</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, 838-841, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.
