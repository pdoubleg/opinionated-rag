       "'This in no way interfered with Fidelitone\\'s use of the premises. (Citations omitted) (emphasis added). In its initial brief in this Court, BTR argues that its actions did not constitute a constructive eviction. This argument, however, invokes the wrong doctrine of law, because the doctrine of constructive eviction is not applicable to the facts of the case sub judice. [2] In its reply brief, BTR clarifies that the circuit court erred in finding that BTR evicted Source Interlink from the property. According to BTR, Source Interlink (1) had decommissioned the property and was only using it to store equipment, (2) \"continued to store and showcase property in the facility\" even after Fidelitone had left, (3) was informed at all times by BTR that Fidelitone\\'s occupancy was only temporary, and (4) \"maintained the keys to the premises and continued to access the property weekly.\" Such facts, argues BTR, demonstrate that BTR did not \"interfere[ ] with any of the activities which Source [Interlink] conducted in the space prior to, during or after the flood.\" Because Source Interlink\\'s \"use of the space and its activities with respect to *152 the space never changed,\" BTR argues that it was \"impossible to have an actual eviction.\" We disagree and explain. Our review of Maryland case law has disclosed no definition of \"actual eviction.\" Black\\'s Law Dictionary 35 (6th ed.1990) defines actual eviction as \"[a]n actual expulsion of the tenant out of all or some part of the demised premises. A physical ouster or dispossession from the very thing granted or some substantial part thereof. \" (Emphasis added). Thompson on Real Property § 41.03(c)(2), entitled \"Actual Eviction by the Landlord,\" explains: The landlord will be in breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment if the landlord, or someone for whose acts the landlord is responsible, wrongfully ousts the tenant from the leased premises. The cases refer to this conduct, which can take the form of physical expulsion or a physical exclusion of the tenant from the leased premises, as an actual eviction. Particular acts by the landlord that have been found to be sufficient to constitute actual eviction of a tenant have included changing the locks on the leased premises, refusing to permit the tenant to enter a building in which space has been leased, padlocking the entry to the leased premises, and taking possession of the leased premises with threats of violence against the tenant or members of the tenant\\'s family if they attempt to re- enter. The cases also recognize that the landlord\\'s eviction efforts may deprive the tenant of only a portion of the leased premises, leaving the tenant in possession of the remainder. If the landlord deprives the tenant of a significant portion of the leased premises, the landlord\\'s conduct will generally be regarded as constituting a partial actual eviction, and a breach of the implied covenant. (Emphasis added) (footnotes omitted); see also Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters, 98 Cal. App. 4th 1141, 120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 162, 168-69 (2002) (\"The legal definition of an eviction is the same: an eviction\\' is[t]he act or process of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.\\' (Black\\'s Law Dict. (7th ed.1999) p. 575, col. 2.) A wrongful eviction thus occurs when the person recovering the property had no right to dispossess the other party from the property.\" (Alteration in original)); cf. Day v. Watson, 8 Mich. 535, 536 (1860) (\"[T]he entry being followed by a continuous possession, which was inconsistent with the possessory title assured to the tenants under the lease, that possession amounts very clearly to an eviction.\"). The Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 6.1 (hereinafter \"the Restatement\"), provides in pertinent part: Except to the extent the parties to a lease validly agree otherwise, there is a breach of the landlord\\'s obligations if, during the period the tenant is entitled to possession of the leased property, the landlord, or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, interferes with a permissible use of the leased property by the tenant. (Emphasis added). Comment (a) to section 6.1 of the Restatement states that \"[t]he conduct in § 6.1 is more commonly referred to as an eviction by the landlord.\" (Emphasis added). Comment (b) to section 6.1 of the Restatement further explains that \"[a]n unauthorized possession of all or any part of the leased property by the landlord, or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, is an eviction of the tenant that could be cured by the tenant himself.\" One of the Illustrations given in Comment (b) is particularly relevant to the instant case: *153 L leases land to T. T enters the leased property. Six months later L, without T\\'s consent, takes possession of a building located on a remote corner of the leased premises that T is not currently using. L\\'s possession of part of the leased property is unauthorized, and L is interfering with a permissible use thereof by T. The actions of BTR in allowing Fidelitone to take possession of the premises leased to Source Interlink are more extensive than the Illustration discussed above. Source Interlink leased approximately 126,786 square feet of the Hampstead Facility, of which 114,891 square feet was warehouse space and 11,895 square feet was office space. Clark, a member of BTR, \"testified that Fidelitone used and occupied 115,000 square feet of Source Interlink\\'s space, constituting substantially all of Source Interlink\\'s warehouse space.\" Although there was testimony that Source Interlink stored \"a large piece of equipment\" in the warehouse during the time Fidelitone occupied the premises, the impact of such equipment on the warehouse space used by Fidelitone was negligible. The equipment referred to was Source Interlink\\'s air system, consisting mainly of a Twinn City Fan and Blower, which was mounted on the roof. Source Interlink wanted to sell the air system, and estimated that its removal would cost $8,500.00.'"

A nonpossessing tenant, whose loss concerns solely the interference with the right to possession under the lease, does not possess tangible property rights. However, upon taking legal possession, a tenant has a possessory property right in the premises. | In the context provided, the court clarified that a tenant does not possess tangible property rights merely based on their lease agreement and the anticipated right to occupy the property. This right transforms into a tangible property right only when the tenant actually takes possession of the property. Hence, prior to possession, allegations of loss related to interference with the right to possession do not qualify as claims for property damage under insurance policies that define property damage as damage to tangible property. This decision impacts how insurance coverage may be interpreted in cases involving tenants' rights and claims for property damage. |\n",

       "Here, R & H, tenants of the Property, have sued Plaintiffs, their landlords, for invading their right of private occupancy to the Property, not merely based on the contamination of the property, but also based on Plaintiffs’ alleged failure to inspect and disclose contamination. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Underlying Complaint alleges personal injury claims separate from claims for property damage. 3) Applicability of the Pollution Exclusion The Hartford argues that, even if the Court finds that the Underlying Complaint alleges personal injury damages, the Second Pollution Exclusion bars coverage. The Court disagrees. Although the Second Pollution Exclusion does not expressly state that it applies only to property damage or bodily injury, both pollution exclusions are listed as exclusions under Section IA of the insurance contract, the section of the contract dealing with coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability. Coverage for personal injury claims, on the other hand, is found in Section IB, a separate section containing its own insuring agreement and applicable exclusions. Given the structure of the insurance contract, an insured would reasonably expect that the exclusions listed under Section IA of the insurance contract, including both pollution exclusions, apply only to property damage or bodily injury. See Legarra v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 35 Cal. App.4th 1472, 1477, 42 Cal.Rptr.2d 101 (1995)(find-ing that, given the format of the policy, an insured would reasonably expect the pollution exclusion to apply only to coverage for bodily injury and property damage, despite the lack of specific reference in the pollution exclusion to bodily injury and property damage). Therefore, the Court finds that the pollution exclusions in the insurance contract do not bar coverage for personal injury claims against the insured, and The Hartford has a duty to defend Plaintiffs in the suit filed by R & H. III. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment and DENIES The Hartford’s Motion to Dismiss. IT IS SO ORDERED. . Plaintiffs have also argued that the allegations in the Underlying Complaint cannot be claims for \"property damage,” since the property damage section of the policy applies only to \"tangible property.” Plaintiffs argue that a leasehold interest is not \"tangible property” and therefore damage to a leasehold interest is not property damage as defined in the policy. No California court has directly considered whether a tenant in possession of a property has a tangible property right. In Kazi v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 24 Cal.4th 871, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 15 P.3d 223 (2001), the Supreme Court of California held that an easement represents only a nonposses-sory right to use another’s property, and therefore is not tangible property. Id. at 881, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 15 P.3d 223. In Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters, 98 Cal. App.4th 1141, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162 (2002), a California appellate court applied the reasoning of Kazi to hold that a nonpossessing tenant, whose claimed loss concerned solely the interference with its right to possession of real property under the parties’ lease, did not allege damage to a tangible property right. As the court in Cunningham explained, \"[a] tenant’s right to possess property on the lease commencement date is a contractual right that does not mature into a property right until possession actually occurs. A landlord's failure to deliver possession of the premises merely gives the tenant a right to abandon the tenancy and sue for damages, but does not give the tenant the legal right to act as a possessor of the real property until the date of actual transfer.” Id. at 1155-1156, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162. The clear implication of the Cunningham court’s reasoning is that when a tenant legally takes possession of the premises, the tenant, unlike an easement holder or a nonpossessing tenant, has a possessory property right in the premises. As such, a tenant in possession presumably has a tangible property interest in the premises and can assert claims for property damage, as defined in the insurance contract."

      "seeking, inter alia, (1) a declaration that its Agreement of Lease (\"Lease\")\n",

      "2007, BTR filed a counterclaim against Source Interlink for \"rent due and\n",

      "square feet of space adjacent to Source Interlink's premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In March 2006, Source Interlink acquired Anderson News, LLC\n",
      "(\"Anderson\"), which included acquisition of the Lease at the Hampstead\n",
      "Facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. The Lease at issue in this case was first executed in November 1999 and\n",
      "is for approximately 126,786 square feet which is comprised of 114,891 sq.\n",
      "ft. of warehouse space and 11,895 sq. ft. of office space.\n",
      "16. The Lease will expire by its terms on January 31, 2010.\n",

      "33. After acquiring the [L]ease from Anderson News in March 2006, Source\n",
      "Interlink continued to use the space as a distribution center for\n",
      "approximately five months, until late August or early September of 2006.\n",
      "34. In approximately September 2006, Source Interlink began decommissioning\n",
      "the leased premises as a distribution *145 center and moving that portion of\n",
      "Source Interlink's operations to a distribution center in Lancaster,\n",
      "P[ennsylvania]. The decommissioning process took about two months.\n",

      "\"go dark,\" which is a term used by Source Interlink to mean that the space\n",
      "was no longer being actively used for the purposes of that Facility, but\n",

      "the facility to ensure that safety and maintenance concerns are addressed on\n",
      "a regular basis.\n",
      "39. Robert Schuler (\"Schuler\"), Source Interlink's National Maintenance\n",
      "Manager, hired Harold Raines (\"Raines\") to periodically inspect the leased\n",
      "premises after it was decommissioned.\n",
      "40. Raines began visiting Source Interlink's leased premises to check on it\n",
      "around the middle of October 2006.\n",
      "41. Between October 2007 and April 2007, Raines visited Source Interlink's\n",

      "months. During warm weather months, Raines visited once a week.\n",

      "44. Source Interlink attempted to sublease the premises in the fall of 2006\n",
      "after the premises had been decommissioned.\n",
      "45. The subleasing efforts were coordinated by Mohr Partners, Inc., who in\n",
      "turn hired a local real estate [broker] to conduct the marketing of the\n",

      "46. Source Interlink requested Mohr Partners to hire a new local real\n",

      "in the Source Interlink space ended no later than June 15, 2007.\n",
      "101. A hole was cut in the demising wall between the Fidelitone space and\n",
      "the Source Interlink space on the day of the flood. Fidelitone began using\n",
      "forklifts to move [its] product into the Source Interlink space immediately.\n",

      "105. Fidelitone was able to start operating again on May 29, 2007, the\n",
      "Tuesday after Memorial Day Weekend. There was no interruption in\n",
      "Fidelitone's business operations as a result of the flooding of its space.\n",
      "106. BTR never asked Source Interlink for its consent to allow Fidelitone\n",
      "to use Source Interlink's premises.\n",
      "107. Source Interlink never gave permission or authorization to BTR to\n",
      "allow Fidelitone to enter Source Interlink's leased premises, use the\n",

      "Interlink's leased premises for the first time, he called Schuler, his\n",
      "contact at Source Interlink, to inform him. Schuler was not aware of what\n",
      "had occurred at the Hampstead Facility until Raines informed him.\n",
      "112. [Thomas] Ramage[, the National Property Manager of Source Interlink],\n",
      "did not find out about the flood and Fidelitone moving into Source\n",

      "dated June 8, 2007, from Rodgers to Ramage. Ramage did not receive the\n",
      "letter until June 18, 2007. Rodgers' letter stated that there had been a\n",

      "\"temporarily\" move some product into Source Interlink's space while\n",
      "Fidelitone's space was restored, and that BTR would be moving Fidelitone's\n",

      "nature of Fidelitone's usage of Source Interlink's space.\n",
      "115. Fidelitone moved the majority of its product (about sixty percent)\n",

      "Interlink's space for most of the time it was using and occupying Source\n",
      "Interlink's space. The average number of pallets of product Fidelitone kept\n",
      "in the Source Interlink space between Memorial Day and the end of October\n",
      "was approximately 1,000 to 1,200 pallets.\n",
      "119. Fidelitone used the bay doors in Source Interlink's space for\n",
      "unloading trucks and receiving product. This was an improved operating\n",
      "situation for Fidelitone because the Source Interlink space provided\n",
      "Fidelitone an additional number of bay doors.\n",
      "120. At any given time, approximately ten Fidelitone employees would be\n",
      "working in the Source Interlink space.\n",
      "121. Clark[, from BTR] testified that Fidelitone used and occupied 115,000\n",
      "square feet of Source Interlink's space, constituting substantially all of\n",
      "Source Interlink's warehouse space.\n",
      "\n",
      "124. On July 2, 2007, Ramage went into the Source Interlink space and\n",
      "observed that roughly one-hundred thousand square feet of the warehouse\n",

      "number of forklifts moving back and forth and that delivery trucks were\n",
      "being loaded and offloaded from the bay doors of the leased premises. He\n",
      "also observed that there was a large hole in the demising wall between the\n",
      "leased premises and Fidelitone's space. Ramage had trouble opening the\n",
      "access doors to the Source Interlink space because Fidelitone had put\n",
      "pallets of inventory stacked six to eight feet tall.\n",
      "125. Ramage also observed during his visit on July 2, 2007, that Fidelitone\n",
      "was using Source Interlink battery chargers to charge Fidelitone's\n",
      "forklifts.\n",
      "126. Raines observed during his visits that the amount of Fidelitone's\n",
      "inventory being stored in Source Interlink's leased premises increased and\n",
      "that Fidelitone's use of the space appeared to be a \"full operation.\" Raines\n",
      "observed that all the bay doors were open, trucks were backed up to the bay\n",
      "doors for loading and forklifts were moving equipment around.\n",
      "127. Fidelitone received the benefit of use of the heating and electric\n",
      "utility in Source Interlink's leased premises.\n",
      "128. BTR admits that Fidelitone acted like a tenant in Source Interlink's\n",

      "and utilizing the Source Interlink loading/unloading docks.\n",
      "\n",
      "130. Ramage inspected the Source Interlink space at the Hampstead Facility\n",
      "on July 2, 2007. Ramage personally observed Fidelitone's usage of the leased\n",
      "premises and took photographs during his July 2, 2007, inspection. Raines\n",
      "met Ramage at the Hampstead Facility on July 2, 2007. No BTR representatives\n",
      "were present during Ramage's July 2 inspection. Ramage immediately\n",
      "telephoned [David] Buck[, Source Interlink's Vice President for Facilities]\n",
      "to inform him.\n",
      "\n",
      "134. A meeting was held between Ramage and Clark at the Hampstead Facility\n",

      "notify him that Fidelitone had been granted access to use the Source\n",
      "Interlink space. Ramage told Clark how \"shocked\" he had been to see on his\n",
      "July 2, 2007, inspection that Fidelitone was actually conducting operations\n",
      "in the Source Interlink space.\n",
      "*148 135. Ramage also told Clark that Source Interlink had not given\n",
      "permission to either BTR or Fidelitone for Fidelitone to use and occupy the\n",
      "leased premises and that Ramage believed BTR to be in breach of the lease.\n",
      "136. Ramage told Clark that Source Interlink had been told that\n",
      "Fidelitone's use and occupancy of the leased premises would only last for a\n",
      "few days or a week, but that it in fact had already lasted more than a\n",

      "approximately two months, during June and July of 2007.\n",
      "142. Even after the July 17, 2007, meeting with Ramage, BTR continued to\n",
      "allow Fidelitone to use and occupy Source Interlink's leased premises.\n",
      "143. No one at BTR told Fidelitone to stop loading and unloading and\n",
      "otherwise to stop operating out of the Source Interlink space. BTR did not\n",
      "give Fidelitone a deadline to get Fidelitone's product out of the Source\n",

      "\n",

      "148. On November 15, 2007, Raines observed Fidelitone still using the\n",

      "149. Fidelitone was not completely out of Source Interlink's space until\n",
      "the last weekend of November 2007.\n",
      "150. BTR did not abate Source Interlink's rent, [common area maintenance\n",

      "and September of 2007.\n",

      "defenses of accord and satisfaction, contributory negligence, estoppel,\n",

      "The actions of BTR in allowing Fidelitone to take possession of the premises\n",
      "leased to Source Interlink are more extensive than the Illustration discussed\n",
      "above. Source Interlink leased approximately 126,786 square feet of the\n",
      "Hampstead Facility, of which 114,891 square feet was warehouse space and\n",
      "11,895 square feet was office space. Clark, a member of BTR, \"testified that\n",
      "Fidelitone used and occupied 115,000 square feet of Source Interlink's space,\n",
      "constituting substantially all of Source Interlink's warehouse space.\"\n",
      "Although there was testimony that Source Interlink stored \"a large piece of\n",
      "equipment\" in the warehouse during the time Fidelitone occupied the premises,\n",
      "the impact of such equipment on the warehouse space used by Fidelitone was\n",
      "negligible. The equipment referred to was Source Interlink's air system,\n",
      "consisting mainly of a Twinn City Fan and Blower, which was mounted on the\n",
      "roof. Source Interlink wanted to sell the air system, and estimated that its\n",
      "removal would cost $8,500.00. The removal of the system would have included\n",
      "removing the rooftop divertor with a crane, removing the existing outside\n",
      "fan/blower motor and all attached ductwork, and patching three rooftop holes.\n",
      "Based on this removal plan, it is clear that the \"large piece of equipment\"\n",
      "had no impact on the square footage of Source Interlink's warehouse space used\n",
      "by Fidelitone. Consequently, Fidelitone took possession of virtually all of\n",
      "Source Interlink's warehouse space for approximately six months, from the end\n",
      "of May of 2007 until the last weekend of November of 2007.\n",
      "Additionally, Fidelitone's use of Source Interlink's leased space was a \"full\n",
      "operation.\" Raines observed that \"all the bay doors were open, trucks were\n",
      "backed up to the bay doors for loading and forklifts were moving equipment\n",

      "Fidelitone's forklifts, as well as the heat and electricity in Source\n",
      "Interlink's premises. BTR admitted that it knew that Fidelitone was acting\n",
      "\"like a tenant in Source Interlink's space\" and that Fidelitone \"was storing\n",
      "product, operating forklifts, and utilizing Source Interlink loading/unloading\n",
      "docks.\"\n",
      "Moreover, Source Interlink neither consented to nor authorized Fidelitone's\n",
      "occupancy and use of its warehouse space. Indeed, BTR unilaterally made the\n",
      "decision to move Fidelitone into Source Interlink's leased warehouse space\n",
      "without informing Source Interlink until approximately three weeks later. The\n",
      "communication informing Source Interlink was a letter describing Fidelitone's\n",
      "possession of the premises as temporary. Ramage, the National Property\n",
      "Manager of Source Interlink, then explicitly informed BTR that Fidelitone was\n",
      "in possession of the warehouse space without Source Interlink's permission.\n",
      "BTR justifies its actions by explaining that Source Interlink had\n",
      "decommissioned the property, and thus the occupancy of Fidelitone did not\n",
      "affect Source Interlink's \"use of the space and its activities with respect to\n",
      "the space.\" As discussed above, an eviction occurs when \"the landlord, or\n",
      "someone whose conduct is attributable to him, interferes with a permissible\n",
      "use of the leased property by the tenant.\" Restatement § 6.1 (emphasis\n",
      "added). Comment *154 (e) of § 6.1 defines \"permissible use\" as\n",

      "any use thereof that the tenant is authorized to make. That particular\n",
      "conduct does not interfere with the manner in which the tenant is currently\n",

      "(Emphasis added). Accordingly, the fact that Source Interlink's actual use of\n",
      "the leased premises was not affected by Fidelitone's occupancy and use of such\n",
      "premises does not negate the finding of an actual eviction.\n",
      "In sum, a landlord cannot permit one tenant to occupy the space of another\n",
      "without the latter's permission. Clearly, the unauthorized possession of\n",
      "Source Interlink's warehouse space by Fidelitone is attributable to BTR and is\n",
      "sufficient to constitute the actual eviction of Source Interlink. Therefore,\n",
      "the circuit court did not err in concluding that BTR evicted Source Interlink\n",
      "from the leased premises.\n",

      "its right to claim an eviction and to declare the Lease terminated?_\n",
      "A.\n",
      "Waiver of Right to Declare an Eviction\n",
      "In its closing memorandum of law before the circuit court, BTR argued that\n",
      "Source Interlink waived the right to claim a constructive eviction, because,\n",
      "during Fidelitone's occupancy of the space, Source Interlink \"continued to\n",
      "pay rent and other charges from BTR [for four months], moved equipment out of\n",
      "the space, approached [a prospective tenant] about subleasing the space, and\n",
      "retained a new broker to assist in subleasing the property.\" BTR also argued\n",
      "that Source Interlink \"never terminated the lease or took action to express a\n",
      "belief that the lease was terminated until it filed this suit four months\n",
      "after the flood,\" and, \"with the exception of paying BTR, nothing changed in\n",
      "the manner in which Source [Interlink] approached the property before, during\n",
      "or after the Fidelitone occupation.\" Therefore, BTR concluded that Source\n",
      "Interlink's acts were \"completely inconsistent with a party claiming to have\n",
      "been constructively evicted,\" and that \"[j]udgment on the [c]omplaint and the\n",
      "[c]ounterclaim must be entered in favor of BTR.\"\n",
      "On appeal, despite minor changes, BTR's argument in its original brief is\n",
      "identical to the argument in its closing memorandum. In other words, the\n",
      "gravamen of BTR's argument is that Source Interlink waived its right to a\n",
      "declare a constructive eviction because it waited an unreasonable time before\n",
      "vacating the premises.[3] As discussed above, the action of BTR constituted an\n",
      "actual eviction, and thus Source Interlink did not have to prove that it\n",
      "vacated the premises, which is an element of constructive eviction. See\n",
      "Stevan v. Brown, 54 Md.App. 235, 240, 458 *155 A.2d 466 (1983) (stating that\n",
      "a constructive eviction \"occurs when the acts of a landlord cause serious or\n",
      "substantial interference with the tenants' enjoyment of the property which\n",
      "results in the tenant vacating the premises\"). Consequently, BTR's waiver\n",
      "argument is inapplicable in the context of the instant case.\n",
      "Even if we were to consider this issue, we agree with the circuit court that\n",
      "Source Interlink did not waive its right to declare an eviction for the period\n",
      "from the time of the flood in May 2007 until the filing of the instant action\n",

      "nothing amounting to consideration from BTR from the date of the flood to\n",

Universal City Studios, Inc. supports the principle that a flea market owner (like the video cassette recorder manufacturer in Sony) cannot be held liable for contributory copyright infringement simply because the structure of the flea market allows for the possibility that a vendor might sell infringing goods. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of liability if the flea market owner has constructive knowledge of the infringement based on specific facts.                                                                                                                                               |\n",

This ruling highlights the legal foundation for holding defendants responsible for the infringement actions of third parties, refuting the defense that damages were solely the result of third party actions over which the defendant had no knowledge, authority, or control.                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Supp. 2d 1029 | Does the sale of software that can be used for infringing activities constitute contributory copyright infringement?                                                                 | The sale of a product that is capable of substantial noninfringing uses does not automatically result in contributory infringement, even if the product might be used for illicit purposes. The court distinguished this principle from sole reliance on the product's potential for lawful use, suggesting that liability for contributory infringement requires actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement when the infringer is in a position to prevent those acts.                                                                                                                                            | In the case of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., the district court concluded that as long as the software could be used for substantial noninfringing purposes, and there was no evidence of the defendants' timely knowledge of specific acts of infringement that they could prevent, they could not be found liable for contributory copyright infringement. This decision was based on the principle that the potential for lawful use of a product does not suffice to establish contributory infringement liability without actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement being demonstrated.                                                                       |\n",

Neither the Copyright Act nor federal common law recognize a copyright in-fringer’s right to contribution. Third-party direct liability is an element of an allegation of secondary liability, which involves either contributory or vicarious liability. Defendants can be held responsible for the infringement of third parties if they had knowledge of and materially contributed to that party’s infringing activity or had the ability to supervise and control it and financially benefited from it. | In the case of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., it was clarified that every case of contributory or vicarious liability necessarily involves the defendant being held to answer for the direct conduct of another. The court elaborated on the aspects of contributory and vicarious liability, indicating that defendants cannot seek contribution from third parties for acts of copyright infringement. The defendants in this context are held liable for the actions of third parties (i.e., vendors) because they either had knowledge and materially contributed to the infringing activity or had the ability to supervise, control, and financially benefit from it. |\n",
       "| 259 F.

This decision aligns with Verizon's stance and supports a broader interpretation that service platforms cannot be held contributorily liable for the actions of their users in such cases of copyright infringement, pending specific conditions and interpretations of the law.                                                                                                                 |\n",

For liability to attach, the defendant must have knowledge of direct infringement at the time they materially contribute to that infringement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Despite Sinnott's reliance on Grokster to argue that actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement is required, the Grokster decision does not affirm this requirement for Sinnott's case. Instead, it emphasizes the timing of the knowledge in relation to the contribution to infringement, indicating that knowledge at the time of contribution is critical for establishing secondary liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",
