As the term implies, headnotes appearat the beginning of the published opinion. Frequently, headnotes are value-added components appended to decisions by the publisher who compiles the decisions of a court for resale. As handed down by the court, a decision or written opinion does not contain headnotes. These are added later by an editor not connected to the court, but who instead works for a legal publishing house."
