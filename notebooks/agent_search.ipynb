I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so.

I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online (cause bills).\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nMICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted\\n“Can you get me in a few”\\n“You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one”\\n“Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬”\\nAt the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride.\\nMy boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nMaryland, USA\\nFirst question here, basically title. What do I need to know before I (a highschool student and minor) attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough movement organized by the Women\\'s March Group? \\nIn particular I have these questions:\\n\\n-Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently than participators? \\n\\n-How are organizers/participators usually punished?\\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI don’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a r/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp;amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m not looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more so for future reference. \\nI’ve done a bit of googling &amp;amp; can’t come up with anything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also feel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp;amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3 jobs total, 1 for 2 &amp;amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp;amp; another for like 2-3 months. \\nAwhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp;amp; had to request a day off (some months out) for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor was the one that scheduling was dealt with through. \\nI request the day off &amp;amp; tell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment. \\nShe asks me “what kind of doctor?” \\nI was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type of doctor I was going to be seeing. \\nShe then says “I need to know what for.” \\nI feel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I explained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp;amp; she seemed satisfied enough. I got the day off. \\nBasically I’m just curious if this is common practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s not? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp;amp; might be overthinking it altogether. \\n(Obligatory apology for mobile formatting)\\n\\nHey there Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells smoking paraphernalia  (pipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...) and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County (the two potential areas I would consider operating). The closest store I have seen to this was in Toronto(clearly not NYC or Nassau County LI).\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of them, though one more than the other. \\n\\nWhen it comes to things like FMLA and the other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include both clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?\\n\\nClinic A has 14 employees, clinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time (Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday) in clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\n\\nThank you in advance.\\n\\nHello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but only just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a bit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just due to concerns.\\n\\nJust as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a relatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering the phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in civil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the basement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I performed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to the department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a backup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent reviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I started to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before; secondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a little unhealthy.\\n\\nI should preface this by saying I have several mental health issues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel comfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble with memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and while I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two days. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my previous position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are being counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a year at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal admonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were apparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the same building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take back my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to affirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my supervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either department, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told me that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and that they may have done this in the past.\\n\\nTo try and shorten this all: despite my having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are spreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions. I fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and contact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and fire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have trouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate advice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.\\n\\nI work for a small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to create a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the legality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the position to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the position  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them first, but they would not be best for the company. I am trying to convince her to hire from the outside so that our problems are more likely to be solved. However, I don\\'t want her to do anything illegal that will harm her business.

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n What are the legal issues involving medical marijuana and employment?\\n\\n    The response should be presented as a list of key points, after creating the title of the content,\\n    formatted in Markdown with appropriate markup for clarity and organization.\\n     \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is any available background question + answer pairs:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n Question 0: 1. What legal implications exist regarding medical marijuana and workplace policies?\\nAnswer: Workplace policies can supersede an individual\\'s possession of a medical marijuana card, potentially leading to conflicts between state laws allowing medical marijuana use and company policies prohibiting it. Employers may enforce zero-tolerance drug policies, even in states where medical marijuana is legal, and this can impact an employee\\'s job status. Additionally, there may be legal implications related to discrimination against medical marijuana patients in the hiring process, as seen in the case of the individual in New York who was refused employment after disclosing their medical marijuana card.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: 2. How does medical marijuana affect employment laws?\\nAnswer: Medical marijuana can impact employment laws differently depending on the state. It is important to consider the specific regulations in each state regarding medical marijuana use, drug testing policies, and workplace discrimination laws. Employers may have varying approaches to medical marijuana use by employees, especially in relation to drug testing, hiring decisions, and workplace policies.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: 3. What are the current debates on using medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The current debates on using medical marijuana in the workplace revolve around the conflict between state laws legalizing medical marijuana and company policies that maintain zero tolerance drug policies. Issues such as whether having a medical marijuana card protects an employee from repercussions at work, the impact on safety-sensitive positions, and the potential for discrimination against medical marijuana patients in the hiring process are key points of contention in these debates. Additionally, concerns about privacy rights, HIPAA violations, and the intersection of state and federal laws further contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding the use of medical marijuana in the workplace.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3: 4. Are there specific legal cases related to medical marijuana use and employment issues?\\nAnswer: Yes, there have been legal cases related to medical marijuana use and employment issues in various states.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 4: 5. How do different states handle the intersection of medical marijuana and workplace regulations?\\nAnswer: Different states handle the intersection of medical marijuana and workplace regulations differently. Some states have specific laws protecting medical marijuana patients from discrimination in the workplace, while others allow employers to enforce their own drug policies, which may include drug testing and potential consequences for employees who test positive for marijuana, even if they are medical marijuana patients. It is important for individuals to be aware of the laws in their specific state regarding medical marijuana and workplace regulations to understand their rights and potential risks.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana.

They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nMICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlet’s call him Jim\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m shared my text with my boss \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBob\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted\\n“Can you get me in a few”\\n“You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one”\\n“Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬”\\nAt the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride.\\nMy boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDecreasing by .75C/HR\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nMaryland, USA\\nFirst question here, basically title. What do I need to know before I \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32ma highschool student and minor\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough movement organized by the Women\\'s March Group? \\nIn particular I have these questions:\\n\\n-Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently than participators? \\n\\n-How are organizers/participators usually punished?\\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI don’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a r/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m not looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more so for future reference. \\nI’ve done a bit of googling &amp; can’t come up with anything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also feel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3 jobs total, 1 for 2 &amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp; another for like 2-3 months. \\nAwhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp; had to request a day off \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32msome months out\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor was the one that scheduling was dealt with through. \\nI request the day off &amp; tell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment. \\nShe asks me “what kind of doctor?” \\nI was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type of doctor I was going to be seeing. \\nShe then says “I need to know what for.” \\nI feel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I explained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp; she seemed satisfied enough. I got the day off. \\nBasically I’m just curious if this is common practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s not? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp; might be overthinking it altogether. \\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mObligatory apology for mobile formatting\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\n\\nHey there Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells smoking paraphernalia  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mpipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthe two potential areas I would consider operating\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. The closest store I have seen to this was in Toronto\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mclearly not NYC or Nassau County LI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of them, though one more than the other. \\n\\nWhen it comes to things like FMLA and the other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include both clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?\\n\\nClinic A has 14 employees, clinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mTuesday Wednesday and Thursday\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\n\\nThank you in advance.\\n\\nHello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but only just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a bit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just due to concerns.\\n\\nJust as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a relatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering the phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in civil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the basement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I performed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to the department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a backup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent reviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I started to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before; secondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a little unhealthy.\\n\\nI should preface this by saying I have several mental health issues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel comfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble with memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and while I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two days. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my previous position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are being counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a year at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal admonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were apparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the same building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take back my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to affirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my supervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either department, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told me that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and that they may have done this in the past.\\n\\nTo try and shorten this all: despite my having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are spreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions. I fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and contact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and fire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have trouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate advice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.\\n\\nI work for a small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to create a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the legality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the position to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the position  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them first, but they would not be best for the company. I am trying to convince her to hire from the outside so that our problems are more likely to be solved. However, I don\\'t want her to do anything illegal that will harm her business. Help!  \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Use the above context and any background question + answer pairs to answer the question: \\n What are the legal issues involving medical marijuana and employment?\\n\\n    The response should be presented as a list of key points, after creating the title of the content,\\n    formatted in Markdown with appropriate markup for clarity and organization.\\n    \\n    '\u001b[0m\n"

       "# Legal Issues Involving Medical Marijuana and Employment\n",
       "\n",
       "Medical marijuana and employment law is a complex and evolving area. Below are key points addressing the legal issues that arise when medical marijuana intersects with the workplace:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **State vs. Federal Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, classified as a Schedule I substance. This federal prohibition can affect employment, especially in federally regulated industries or federal government jobs, despite state laws legalizing medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. These policies can often be enforced even in states where medical marijuana is legal, potentially leading to termination or disciplinary action against employees who use medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a legitimate interest in maintaining safety in the workplace. Employees in safety-sensitive positions may be subject to stricter drug use policies, and the use of medical marijuana may not be accommodated, even if it is legal at the state level.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Disability Discrimination**: Some states have laws that protect medical marijuana users from discrimination based on their status as a patient. However, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not require employers to accommodate the use of substances that are illegal under federal law.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, including pre-employment, random, and post-accident testing. A positive test for marijuana can lead to adverse employment actions. The role of medical marijuana cards in drug testing varies by state and employer policy.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **HIPAA and Privacy Concerns**: The disclosure of medical marijuana use may raise privacy concerns. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), medical information should be kept confidential, but this does not prevent employers from taking action based on drug test results.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Impairment at Work**: Employers are not required to tolerate on-the-job impairment, even if the employee is a registered medical marijuana user. Employees must still meet performance standards and conduct themselves appropriately in the workplace.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Accommodations**: Employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana users, but this does not extend to allowing marijuana use at work or excusing impairment during work hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Legal Precedents**: There have been legal cases where employees have challenged termination or discrimination based on medical marijuana use. The outcomes of these cases can vary significantly by state and the specific circumstances involved.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Employment Contracts and Union Agreements**: Individual employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that can impact medical marijuana users.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted laws that provide specific protections for medical marijuana patients, including protections against employment discrimination. It is crucial for employees and employers to be aware of the laws in their particular state.\n",
       "\n",
       "12. **Employer's Business Interests**: Employers may argue that accommodating medical marijuana use could lead to increased costs, safety risks, or conflicts with other employees or customers, which can influence their policies and actions regarding medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "13. **Changing Legal Landscape**: As more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana, the legal landscape continues to change. Employers and employees must stay informed about new laws and court decisions that could affect their rights and obligations.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important for both employers and employees to seek legal advice to navigate the complexities of medical marijuana in the workplace, as the interplay between state laws, federal law, and company policies can create a challenging legal environment."

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nIs that legal discrimination?\\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated\\n\\ntrying to build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado\\n\\nI applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis. \\n\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\n\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was discrimination. \\n\\nI don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer deemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for authorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be transitioned back into the workplace.\\n\\nAm I required to do this to retain my job?\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spout off about what\\'s right and wrong, but I do want to ask if there is anything dubious in a legal sense about this practice? I can see the arguments for both sides, but I don\\'t know enough about federal and state Labor laws\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nMy roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\n\\nMICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted\\n“Can you get me in a few”\\n“You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one”\\n“Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬”\\nAt the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride.\\nMy boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHi All,\\n\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on. I am in HR, but I am still getting experienced, so I wanted to run this by some other professionals, including you legal folk.\\n\\nI just received a job offer today for a job that I cannot wait to take. Regardless of the verbiage, I will take it; however, I really dislike it and think that maybe I could help clean it up a bit.\\n\\nTermination. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated immediately at the option of Employer on the occurrence of any one of the following events:\\n\\n* Death of Employee\\n\\n* Employee becomes mentally or physically disabled. Employee shall be deemed to be mentally or physically disabled if he is prevented from performing his duties hereunder for a continuous period of ten (10) weeks or an aggregate period of twelve (12) weeks during any sixteen (16) week period during which this Agreement is in effect\\n\\nFor Cause\" which shall mean:\\n\\n* conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime which has or may have a material adverse effect on Employee’s ability to carry out his duties under this Agreement or upon the reputation of Employer;\\n\\n* a violation by Employee of any of his obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement;\\n\\n* conduct involving moral turpitude or unprofessional conduct tending to injure the reputation of Employer;\\nmaterial and continuing failure by Employee to perform his duties under this Agreement in a quality and professional manner for at least thirty (30) days after written notice by Employer\\n\\n* employee otherwise breaches a material provision of this Agreement\\n\\nSo my biggest issues:\\n\\n* Employee becomes mentally or physically disabled. Employee shall be deemed to be mentally or physically disabled if he is prevented from performing his duties hereunder for a continuous period of ten (10) weeks or an aggregate period of twelve (12) weeks during any sixteen (16) week period during which this Agreement is in effect\\n\\nDoesn\\'t this potentially violate ADA, and stand in counter with FMLA? This is the one I have the most trouble with, and would welcome your help.\\n\\nThe second issue is with the next bullet:\\n\\nFor Cause\" which shall mean:\\n\\n* conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime which has or may have a material adverse effect on Employee’s ability to carry out his duties under this Agreement or upon the reputation of Employer;\\n\\n* a violation by Employee of any of his obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement;\\n\\n* conduct involving moral turpitude or unprofessional conduct tending to injure the reputation of Employer;\\nmaterial and continuing failure by Employee to perform his duties under this Agreement in a quality and professional manner for at least thirty (30) days after written notice by Employer\\n\\n* employee otherwise breaches a material provision of this Agreement\\n\\nPA is an at-will state, so the company has the right to terminate employment whenever, for whatever cause. Would this be something they are including so that if a breach occurs they could produce evidence and not have to pay Unemployment?

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana.

It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHi All,\\n\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on.

Would this be something they are including so that if a breach occurs they could produce evidence and not have to pay Unemployment? In my experience with PA, judges heavily side with the employee, even if the employee has done a wrongdoing.

Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person's system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\"</span>\n",

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nIs that legal discrimination?\\n\\nI currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am not able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break unless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this issue and advice on course of action would be appreciated\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations.

Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nIs that legal discrimination?\\n\\nI currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am not able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break unless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this issue and advice on course of action would be appreciated\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of them, though one more than the other. \\n\\nWhen it comes to things like FMLA and the other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include both clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?\\n\\nClinic A has 14 employees, clinic B has 6.

Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York's Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state's laws.\\n\"</span>\n",

       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person's system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries.

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nMy employer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t effective until 2019. \\nI have two questions. One, can my employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nI applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis. \\n\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\n\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was discrimination. \\n\\nI don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online (cause bills).\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nI currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am not able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break unless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this issue and advice on course of action would be appreciated\\n\\nMy roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\n\\nI was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer deemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for authorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be transitioned back into the workplace.\\n\\nAm I required to do this to retain my job?\\n\\nHow to establish employers run background checks? Do they use website like mylife.com or online website to do background checks?\\n\\nIs that legal discrimination?\\n\\nCompany policy states under reasonable suspicion a urinalysis sample for a 9 panel drug test is required.\\n\\nQuestion: if HR ordered a 10 panel drug test, does this make them non compliant with their own policies? \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Use the above context and any background question + answer pairs to answer the question: \\n How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\n    '</span>\n",

Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York\\'s Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state\\'s laws.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nMy employer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t effective until 2019. \\nI have two questions. One, can my employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nI applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis. \\n\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\n\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was discrimination. \\n\\nI don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mI have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nI currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am not able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break unless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this issue and advice on course of action would be appreciated\\n\\nMy roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mWe each have our own lease\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mincluding bongs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\n\\nI was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer deemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for authorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be transitioned back into the workplace.\\n\\nAm I required to do this to retain my job?\\n\\nHow to establish employers run background checks? Do they use website like mylife.com or online website to do background checks?\\n\\nIs that legal discrimination?\\n\\nCompany policy states under reasonable suspicion a urinalysis sample for a 9 panel drug test is required.\\n\\nQuestion: if HR ordered a 10 panel drug test, does this make them non compliant with their own policies? \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Use the above context and any background question + answer pairs to answer the question: \\n How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\n    '\u001b[0m\n"

Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York's Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state's laws.\\n\"</span>,\n",

Here's how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee's medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\"</span>\n",

       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person's system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries.

Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spout off about what\\'s right and wrong, but I do want to ask if there is anything dubious in a legal sense about this practice? I can see the arguments for both sides, but I don\\'t know enough about federal and state Labor laws\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nHi All,\\n\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on. I am in HR, but I am still getting experienced, so I wanted to run this by some other professionals, including you legal folk.\\n\\nI just received a job offer today for a job that I cannot wait to take.

Would this be something they are including so that if a breach occurs they could produce evidence and not have to pay Unemployment? In my experience with PA, judges heavily side with the employee, even if the employee has done a wrongdoing. Are they really protecting themselves here?\\n\\nYour assistance is greatly appreciated.\\n\\nMy roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nMy employer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t effective until 2019. \\nI have two questions. One, can my employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\n\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated\\n\\ntrying to build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nI\\'m a little unclear as to what I can actually expect to happen December 1st when the [rewrite goes into effect](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=50d56525-ba39-4ec0-a5ed-076a1bffe7bd).\\n\\nI work as a counselor for adults with special needs. My time during the week is paid hourly but if I work a weekend day it\\'s a 24 hour shift that\\'s paid salary. \\n\\nI know this is illegal, I\\'m actually in the process of filing a claim with the Dept of Labor about it, but if our director decides to abide by this revision in the regulations what might happen to our weekend days?\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online (cause bills).\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis. \\n\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\n\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was discrimination. \\n\\nI don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?\\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer.

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law? \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is any available background question + answer pairs:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York\\'s Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state\\'s laws.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here\\'s how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee\\'s medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spout off about what\\'s right and wrong, but I do want to ask if there is anything dubious in a legal sense about this practice? I can see the arguments for both sides, but I don\\'t know enough about federal and state Labor laws\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nHi All,\\n\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on. I am in HR, but I am still getting experienced, so I wanted to run this by some other professionals, including you legal folk.\\n\\nI just received a job offer today for a job that I cannot wait to take.

Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mI have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis. \\n\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\n\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was discrimination. \\n\\nI don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?\\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.  \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Use the above context and any background question + answer pairs to answer the question: \\n In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law?\\n    '\u001b[0m\n"

Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person's system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\"</span>,\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #7fbf7f; text-decoration-color: #7fbf7f\">│   </span><span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\"Question 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York's Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state's laws.\\n\"</span>,\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #7fbf7f; text-decoration-color: #7fbf7f\">│   </span><span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\"Question 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here's how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee's medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\"</span>,\n",

Here are some of the key areas of impact:\\n\\n1. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. However, in states where medical marijuana is legal, these policies may need to be reconciled with state laws that provide protections for medical marijuana users. Employers must carefully craft their policies to comply with both state and federal regulations.\\n\\n2. **Discrimination and Accommodation**: In some states, laws protect medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. Employers may need to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are legally using medical marijuana, as long as it does not cause undue hardship or compromise workplace safety. This can be particularly challenging in safety-sensitive industries.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing**: Employers often use drug testing to maintain a safe and drug-free workplace. However, because marijuana can remain in the system long after use, a positive test for THC does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers must navigate state laws that may protect medical marijuana users from adverse employment actions based on a positive drug test.\\n\\n4. **Safety Concerns**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee's legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive. Employers must balance safety requirements with the rights of employees who use medical marijuana for legitimate health reasons.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Issues**: When an employee discloses their status as a medical marijuana patient, employers must handle this sensitive information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws, while also considering the implications for workplace policies and safety.\\n\\n6. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. For example, if an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation.\\n\\n7. **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which can create conflicts in states where medical marijuana is legal. This is particularly relevant for federal employees or those working in federally regulated industries, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n8. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\\n\\n9. **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n10. **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: As the legal landscape continues to evolve, employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\\n\\nIn summary, medical marijuana impacts labor and employment law by introducing a range of legal considerations that employers must navigate, including compliance with state and federal laws, workplace safety, discrimination, accommodation, and privacy concerns. The evolving nature of these laws means that both employers and employees must remain vigilant and informed to ensure their actions are legally compliant.\\n\"</span>\n",

       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person's system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one's status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York's Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state's laws.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here's how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee's medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m\"Question 3: In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law?\\nAnswer: Medical marijuana can impact labor and employment law in several ways, creating a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Here are some of the key areas of impact:\\n\\n1. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. However, in states where medical marijuana is legal, these policies may need to be reconciled with state laws that provide protections for medical marijuana users. Employers must carefully craft their policies to comply with both state and federal regulations.\\n\\n2. **Discrimination and Accommodation**: In some states, laws protect medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. Employers may need to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are legally using medical marijuana, as long as it does not cause undue hardship or compromise workplace safety. This can be particularly challenging in safety-sensitive industries.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing**: Employers often use drug testing to maintain a safe and drug-free workplace. However, because marijuana can remain in the system long after use, a positive test for THC does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers must navigate state laws that may protect medical marijuana users from adverse employment actions based on a positive drug test.\\n\\n4. **Safety Concerns**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee's legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive.

I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nMy employer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t effective until 2019. \\nI have two questions. One, can my employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\n\\nThis is in Iowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\" \\n\\nMy question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa? \\n\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks \\n\\nEDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion. \\n\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal? \\n\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?\\n\\nI\\'m a little unclear as to what I can actually expect to happen December 1st when the [rewrite goes into effect](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=50d56525-ba39-4ec0-a5ed-076a1bffe7bd).\\n\\nI work as a counselor for adults with special needs. My time during the week is paid hourly but if I work a weekend day it\\'s a 24 hour shift that\\'s paid salary. \\n\\nI know this is illegal, I\\'m actually in the process of filing a claim with the Dept of Labor about it, but if our director decides to abide by this revision in the regulations what might happen to our weekend days?\\n\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated\\n\\ntrying to build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado\\n\\nCompany policy states under reasonable suspicion a urinalysis sample for a 9 panel drug test is required.\\n\\nQuestion: if HR ordered a 10 panel drug test, does this make them non compliant with their own policies?\\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nMy roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\n\\nHello! I am an activist in Florida and am thinking of various campaigns I could do on my college campus and one such issues I could think of is how campus police are called automatically for suspicion of drug possession or underage drinking. I don’t think police should be introduced to a student space in such a cavalier fashion, especially not residence areas. But I understand that the school may be obligated legally to get the police involved. Are there any resources where I could do more research on whether the university could handle minor drug possession internally rather than potentially introducing students to the criminal justice system or creating unsafe situations for students of color? Thanks, I appreciate it.\\n\\nI was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer deemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for authorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be transitioned back into the workplace.\\n\\nAm I required to do this to retain my job?\\n\\nMany of my classmates and I (300+ students) are planning a walkout on the anniversary of Columbine to protest gun violence in our country. I was wondering what the legal ramifications are, if any, if I choose to protest.   \\n\\nMy roommate recently had a warrant for a driving on a suspended licence. He paid it off and was told the warrant would be thrown out. Today, the cops showed up over said warrant, and found marijuana in the house. It was a decent amount, and now he is in jail. I also received citations for a small amount of marijuana, and a separate one for paraphernalia. \\n\\nIs there anything we can do about this? Could the case be thrown out considering the warrant was supposed to be null, but wasn\\'t due to a clerical error (i assume).\\n\\nWe both have \"the cleanest records we\\'ve seen in a while\" based on the cops own testament, if that has any weight. \\n\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nEdit: I appreciate the quick responses. Thanks for letting me know more about the situation and my options.  \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Use the above context and any background question + answer pairs to answer the question: \\n What are the implications of medical marijuana legalization on workplace policies and regulations?\\n    '</span>\n",

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n What are the implications of medical marijuana legalization on workplace policies and regulations? \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is any available background question + answer pairs:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York\\'s Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state\\'s laws.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here\\'s how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee\\'s medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3: In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law?\\nAnswer: Medical marijuana can impact labor and employment law in several ways, creating a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Here are some of the key areas of impact:\\n\\n1. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. However, in states where medical marijuana is legal, these policies may need to be reconciled with state laws that provide protections for medical marijuana users. Employers must carefully craft their policies to comply with both state and federal regulations.\\n\\n2. **Discrimination and Accommodation**: In some states, laws protect medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. Employers may need to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are legally using medical marijuana, as long as it does not cause undue hardship or compromise workplace safety. This can be particularly challenging in safety-sensitive industries.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing**: Employers often use drug testing to maintain a safe and drug-free workplace. However, because marijuana can remain in the system long after use, a positive test for THC does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers must navigate state laws that may protect medical marijuana users from adverse employment actions based on a positive drug test.\\n\\n4. **Safety Concerns**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee\\'s legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive. Employers must balance safety requirements with the rights of employees who use medical marijuana for legitimate health reasons.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Issues**: When an employee discloses their status as a medical marijuana patient, employers must handle this sensitive information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws, while also considering the implications for workplace policies and safety.\\n\\n6. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. For example, if an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation.\\n\\n7. **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which can create conflicts in states where medical marijuana is legal. This is particularly relevant for federal employees or those working in federally regulated industries, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n8. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\\n\\n9. **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n10. **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: As the legal landscape continues to evolve, employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\\n\\nIn summary, medical marijuana impacts labor and employment law by introducing a range of legal considerations that employers must navigate, including compliance with state and federal laws, workplace safety, discrimination, accommodation, and privacy concerns. The evolving nature of these laws means that both employers and employees must remain vigilant and informed to ensure their actions are legally compliant.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n Hello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nI\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work.

I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT.

The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t effective until 2019. \\nI have two questions.

I am an activist in Florida and am thinking of various campaigns I could do on my college campus and one such issues I could think of is how campus police are called automatically for suspicion of drug possession or underage drinking.

But I understand that the school may be obligated legally to get the police involved. Are there any resources where I could do more research on whether the university could handle minor drug possession internally rather than potentially introducing students to the criminal justice system or creating unsafe situations for students of color?

Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York\\'s Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state\\'s laws.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here\\'s how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee\\'s medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3: In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law?\\nAnswer: Medical marijuana can impact labor and employment law in several ways, creating a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Here are some of the key areas of impact:\\n\\n1. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. However, in states where medical marijuana is legal, these policies may need to be reconciled with state laws that provide protections for medical marijuana users. Employers must carefully craft their policies to comply with both state and federal regulations.\\n\\n2. **Discrimination and Accommodation**: In some states, laws protect medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. Employers may need to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are legally using medical marijuana, as long as it does not cause undue hardship or compromise workplace safety. This can be particularly challenging in safety-sensitive industries.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing**: Employers often use drug testing to maintain a safe and drug-free workplace. However, because marijuana can remain in the system long after use, a positive test for THC does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers must navigate state laws that may protect medical marijuana users from adverse employment actions based on a positive drug test.\\n\\n4. **Safety Concerns**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee\\'s legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive. Employers must balance safety requirements with the rights of employees who use medical marijuana for legitimate health reasons.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Issues**: When an employee discloses their status as a medical marijuana patient, employers must handle this sensitive information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws, while also considering the implications for workplace policies and safety.\\n\\n6. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. For example, if an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation.\\n\\n7. **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which can create conflicts in states where medical marijuana is legal. This is particularly relevant for federal employees or those working in federally regulated industries, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n8. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\\n\\n9. **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n10. **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: As the legal landscape continues to evolve, employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\\n\\nIn summary, medical marijuana impacts labor and employment law by introducing a range of legal considerations that employers must navigate, including compliance with state and federal laws, workplace safety, discrimination, accommodation, and privacy concerns. The evolving nature of these laws means that both employers and employees must remain vigilant and informed to ensure their actions are legally compliant.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 4: What are the implications of medical marijuana legalization on workplace policies and regulations?\\nAnswer: The legalization of medical marijuana has significant implications for workplace policies and regulations, affecting both employers and employees. Here are some of the key implications:\\n\\n1. **Policy Revisions**: Employers may need to revise their drug and alcohol policies to address the use of medical marijuana. This includes clarifying the stance on medical marijuana use, particularly in states where it is legal, and ensuring that policies are compliant with state laws while also considering federal law.\\n\\n2. **Drug Testing**: Employers must navigate the complexities of drug testing in the context of medical marijuana. Since THC can remain in the system for an extended period, a positive test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers in states with legal medical marijuana may need to modify their approach to drug testing and consider the implications of a positive test for employees who are registered medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n3. **Accommodation and Discrimination**: In some states, employers may be required to accommodate the legal use of medical marijuana, which could involve allowing use outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies. Employers must balance these accommodations with maintaining a safe and productive workplace and avoiding discrimination against medical marijuana users while also ensuring compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state-specific laws.\\n\\n4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers must consider the impact of medical marijuana on safety-sensitive positions. While employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, they also need to consider the legal protections that may exist for medical marijuana users. Policies may need to be tailored to address the use of medical marijuana by employees in non-safety-sensitive roles versus those in safety-sensitive roles.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employers must handle information about an employee\\'s medical marijuana use with confidentiality. Disclosures related to medical marijuana use must comply with privacy laws, and employers should ensure that such information is only shared on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n6. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. Employers and employees need to understand how state laws address these issues in the context of medical marijuana use.\\n\\n7. **Federal Contracts and Regulations**: For employers with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal substance, takes precedence. These employers must maintain compliance with federal drug-free workplace requirements, which can be at odds with state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n8. **Training and Communication**: Employers should provide training to HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace. Clear communication with employees about the company\\'s policies regarding medical marijuana is also essential.\\n\\n9. **Legal Challenges**: Employers may face legal challenges from employees who feel their rights as medical marijuana patients have been violated. It is important for employers to stay informed about legal developments and seek legal advice to navigate potential disputes.\\n\\n10. **State-Specific Protections**: Employers must be aware of and comply with state-specific protections for medical marijuana patients. This may include anti-discrimination provisions and the need to consider reasonable accommodations.\\n\\nIn summary, the legalization of medical marijuana requires employers to carefully review and potentially update their workplace policies and regulations to ensure they are legally compliant and address the complexities introduced by medical marijuana use among employees. Employers must balance their duty to maintain a safe and productive workplace with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana for medical purposes.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated\\n\\ntrying to build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online (cause bills).\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nMICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted\\n“Can you get me in a few”\\n“You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one”\\n“Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬”\\nAt the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride.\\nMy boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nMaryland, USA\\nFirst question here, basically title. What do I need to know before I (a highschool student and minor) attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough movement organized by the Women\\'s March Group? \\nIn particular I have these questions:\\n\\n-Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently than participators? \\n\\n-How are organizers/participators usually punished?\\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI don’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a r/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp;amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m not looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more so for future reference. \\nI’ve done a bit of googling &amp;amp; can’t come up with anything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also feel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp;amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3 jobs total, 1 for 2 &amp;amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp;amp; another for like 2-3 months. \\nAwhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp;amp; had to request a day off (some months out) for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor was the one that scheduling was dealt with through. \\nI request the day off &amp;amp; tell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment. \\nShe asks me “what kind of doctor?” \\nI was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type of doctor I was going to be seeing. \\nShe then says “I need to know what for.” \\nI feel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I explained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp;amp; she seemed satisfied enough. I got the day off. \\nBasically I’m just curious if this is common practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s not? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp;amp; might be overthinking it altogether. \\n(Obligatory apology for mobile formatting)\\n\\nHey there Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells smoking paraphernalia  (pipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...) and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County (the two potential areas I would consider operating). The closest store I have seen to this was in Toronto(clearly not NYC or Nassau County LI).\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of them, though one more than the other. \\n\\nWhen it comes to things like FMLA and the other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include both clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?\\n\\nClinic A has 14 employees, clinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time (Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday) in clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\n\\nThank you in advance.\\n\\nHello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but only just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a bit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just due to concerns.\\n\\nJust as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a relatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering the phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in civil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the basement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I performed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to the department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a backup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent reviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I started to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before; secondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a little unhealthy.\\n\\nI should preface this by saying I have several mental health issues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel comfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble with memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and while I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two days. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my previous position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are being counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a year at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal admonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were apparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the same building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take back my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to affirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my supervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either department, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told me that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and that they may have done this in the past.\\n\\nTo try and shorten this all: despite my having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are spreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions. I fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and contact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and fire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have trouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate advice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.\\n\\nI work for a small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to create a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the legality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the position to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the position  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them first, but they would not be best for the company. I am trying to convince her to hire from the outside so that our problems are more likely to be solved. However, I don\\'t want her to do anything illegal that will harm her business.

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n What are the legal issues involving medical marijuana and employment?\\n\\n    The response should be presented as a list of key points, after creating the title of the content,\\n    formatted in Markdown with appropriate markup for clarity and organization.\\n     \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is any available background question + answer pairs:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n Question 0: What legal challenges are present in the intersection of medical marijuana and employment?\\nAnswer: The intersection of medical marijuana and employment presents several legal challenges due to the conflicting federal and state laws, as well as varying company policies. Here are some of the key legal challenges:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance, which creates a conflict with states that have legalized medical marijuana. This discrepancy can affect employment, especially in federal jobs or positions that require federal licensing or contracts, where federal law may take precedence.\\n\\n2. **Workplace Drug Policies**: Many employers maintain strict drug-free workplace policies, which can include zero-tolerance for drug use, including medical marijuana. These policies may be in place for safety reasons, especially in safety-sensitive positions, and can result in the termination of employees who test positive for marijuana, regardless of their medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n3. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana for a disability may face challenges if their employer\\'s actions could be considered discriminatory. The Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, but there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana. Some states have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from employment discrimination, but these protections vary widely and are not universally recognized.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing**: Legal issues arise around drug testing for marijuana, particularly because THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, can remain in a person\\'s system for weeks after use, making it difficult to determine impairment at work. Employers may face challenges in balancing the need for drug testing with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana.\\n\\n5. **Accommodation Requests**: Employees who are medical marijuana patients may request accommodations, such as exemptions from drug testing or permission to use medical marijuana outside of work hours. Employers must consider these requests and determine if they can provide reasonable accommodations without causing undue hardship to the business.\\n\\n6. **Safety Concerns**: Employers in industries with safety-sensitive positions may face legal challenges when trying to reconcile employee rights with public safety. For example, employees who operate heavy machinery or perform tasks that require full cognitive abilities may pose a risk if under the influence of marijuana, even if used for medical purposes.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Issues**: There are also privacy concerns related to medical marijuana use. Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient may be necessary to explain a positive drug test, but this can raise issues related to medical privacy and the potential for discrimination based on health conditions.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. If an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation. Similarly, if an employee is terminated for violating a drug policy, they may be denied unemployment benefits.\\n\\n9. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. However, these protections are not uniform across all states, and the legal landscape is continually evolving.\\n\\n10. **Contractual Agreements and Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may have specific clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal challenges at the intersection of medical marijuana and employment are complex and multifaceted. They require careful navigation of federal and state laws, company policies, and individual employee rights. Employers and employees alike must stay informed about the latest legal developments in their respective states and seek legal advice when necessary to understand their rights and obligations.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: What specific laws govern the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The specific laws governing the use of medical marijuana in the workplace can vary significantly from state to state, and there is also a complex interplay with federal law. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Federal Law**: Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it is illegal at the federal level. This classification affects federal employees and those working in federally regulated industries, such as transportation and defense, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n2. **State Laws**: Many states have passed their own medical marijuana laws that provide varying levels of protection for medical marijuana users. These laws often include provisions that prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana cardholders. However, these protections can be limited, especially when it comes to safety-sensitive positions or when federal law takes precedence.\\n\\n3. **Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m**: The ADA does not protect employees who use illegal drugs, which under federal law includes marijuana. However, some state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of drugs, including marijuana, regardless of its legal status at the state level. These policies can be particularly strict in safety-sensitive industries. However, some states may have laws that limit the ability of employers to discriminate against employees who are medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Some state laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship to the employer or pose a safety risk.\\n\\n7. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing one\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient can raise privacy issues. Employers must handle such information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\\n\\n9. **Specific State Protections**: Some states, like New York and Arizona, have specific protections for medical marijuana patients. For example, New York\\'s Compassionate Care Act includes anti-discrimination provisions for certified patients, meaning that employers cannot discriminate against them solely for their status as medical marijuana patients. However, this does not necessarily protect employees from being disciplined for being impaired by marijuana while on the job.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the legal landscape, it is important for both employers and employees to be aware of the specific laws and regulations in their state, as well as any relevant case law or legal interpretations that may impact the use of medical marijuana in the workplace. Employees facing discrimination or other issues related to medical marijuana use at work should consider seeking legal advice to understand their rights and options under their state\\'s laws.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: How do employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees legally?\\nAnswer: Employers handle medical marijuana use among their employees by navigating a complex legal landscape that includes both federal and state laws, as well as their own company policies. Here\\'s how they may approach the situation legally:\\n\\n1. **Compliance with Federal Law**: Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law, employers, especially those with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, must comply with federal drug-free workplace requirements. This often means prohibiting marijuana use among employees, regardless of state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n2. **Adherence to State Laws**: In states where medical marijuana is legal, employers may need to consider state-specific laws that provide certain protections for medical marijuana users. These laws can vary widely and may offer different levels of protection against discrimination for medical marijuana patients. Employers must be aware of and comply with the relevant state laws where they operate.\\n\\n3. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Many employers maintain drug-free workplace policies that include prohibitions on the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. However, in some states, these policies must be balanced with state laws that protect medical marijuana patients. Employers may need to review and possibly adjust their policies to avoid discrimination claims.\\n\\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under some state laws, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients. This does not mean allowing impairment at work but may involve accommodating the use of medical marijuana outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but they must consider the implications of a positive test for THC. In states with protections for medical marijuana patients, a positive test may not be grounds for automatic termination. Employers need to establish clear drug testing policies that are consistent with state laws.\\n\\n6. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may have more leeway to prohibit marijuana use to ensure workplace safety. This is often the case even in states with medical marijuana laws, as employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment.\\n\\n7. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must respect the privacy of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Information about an employee\\'s medical condition or treatment should be kept confidential and only disclosed on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Employers must consider how medical marijuana use affects claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits, as state laws can differ on whether marijuana use impacts these benefits.\\n\\n9. **Training and Communication**: Employers should train their HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace, including recognizing the signs of impairment and understanding the legal rights of employees.\\n\\n10. **Legal Consultation**: Given the complexity of the issue, employers often seek legal advice to ensure their policies and actions are compliant with both federal and state laws.\\n\\nIn summary, employers legally handle medical marijuana use by carefully considering the interplay of federal and state laws, their own workplace policies, the safety of the workplace, and the rights of employees who are medical marijuana patients. Policies and practices must be regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with the evolving legal landscape.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3: In what ways can medical marijuana impact issues related to labor and employment law?\\nAnswer: Medical marijuana can impact labor and employment law in several ways, creating a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Here are some of the key areas of impact:\\n\\n1. **Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers may have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of marijuana, including medical marijuana. However, in states where medical marijuana is legal, these policies may need to be reconciled with state laws that provide protections for medical marijuana users. Employers must carefully craft their policies to comply with both state and federal regulations.\\n\\n2. **Discrimination and Accommodation**: In some states, laws protect medical marijuana users from employment discrimination. Employers may need to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are legally using medical marijuana, as long as it does not cause undue hardship or compromise workplace safety. This can be particularly challenging in safety-sensitive industries.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing**: Employers often use drug testing to maintain a safe and drug-free workplace. However, because marijuana can remain in the system long after use, a positive test for THC does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers must navigate state laws that may protect medical marijuana users from adverse employment actions based on a positive drug test.\\n\\n4. **Safety Concerns**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee\\'s legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive. Employers must balance safety requirements with the rights of employees who use medical marijuana for legitimate health reasons.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Issues**: When an employee discloses their status as a medical marijuana patient, employers must handle this sensitive information confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws, while also considering the implications for workplace policies and safety.\\n\\n6. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can complicate claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. For example, if an employee is injured on the job and tests positive for marijuana, it may affect their eligibility for workers\\' compensation.\\n\\n7. **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which can create conflicts in states where medical marijuana is legal. This is particularly relevant for federal employees or those working in federally regulated industries, where federal drug-free workplace laws apply.\\n\\n8. **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual\\'s status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\\n\\n9. **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n10. **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: As the legal landscape continues to evolve, employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\\n\\nIn summary, medical marijuana impacts labor and employment law by introducing a range of legal considerations that employers must navigate, including compliance with state and federal laws, workplace safety, discrimination, accommodation, and privacy concerns. The evolving nature of these laws means that both employers and employees must remain vigilant and informed to ensure their actions are legally compliant.\\n\\n\\nQuestion 4: What are the implications of medical marijuana legalization on workplace policies and regulations?\\nAnswer: The legalization of medical marijuana has significant implications for workplace policies and regulations, affecting both employers and employees. Here are some of the key implications:\\n\\n1. **Policy Revisions**: Employers may need to revise their drug and alcohol policies to address the use of medical marijuana. This includes clarifying the stance on medical marijuana use, particularly in states where it is legal, and ensuring that policies are compliant with state laws while also considering federal law.\\n\\n2. **Drug Testing**: Employers must navigate the complexities of drug testing in the context of medical marijuana. Since THC can remain in the system for an extended period, a positive test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. Employers in states with legal medical marijuana may need to modify their approach to drug testing and consider the implications of a positive test for employees who are registered medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n3. **Accommodation and Discrimination**: In some states, employers may be required to accommodate the legal use of medical marijuana, which could involve allowing use outside of work hours or modifying drug testing policies. Employers must balance these accommodations with maintaining a safe and productive workplace and avoiding discrimination against medical marijuana users while also ensuring compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and state-specific laws.\\n\\n4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers must consider the impact of medical marijuana on safety-sensitive positions. While employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, they also need to consider the legal protections that may exist for medical marijuana users. Policies may need to be tailored to address the use of medical marijuana by employees in non-safety-sensitive roles versus those in safety-sensitive roles.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employers must handle information about an employee\\'s medical marijuana use with confidentiality. Disclosures related to medical marijuana use must comply with privacy laws, and employers should ensure that such information is only shared on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\n6. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers\\' compensation and unemployment benefits. Employers and employees need to understand how state laws address these issues in the context of medical marijuana use.\\n\\n7. **Federal Contracts and Regulations**: For employers with federal contracts or those in federally regulated industries, federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal substance, takes precedence. These employers must maintain compliance with federal drug-free workplace requirements, which can be at odds with state medical marijuana laws.\\n\\n8. **Training and Communication**: Employers should provide training to HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace. Clear communication with employees about the company\\'s policies regarding medical marijuana is also essential.\\n\\n9. **Legal Challenges**: Employers may face legal challenges from employees who feel their rights as medical marijuana patients have been violated. It is important for employers to stay informed about legal developments and seek legal advice to navigate potential disputes.\\n\\n10. **State-Specific Protections**: Employers must be aware of and comply with state-specific protections for medical marijuana patients. This may include anti-discrimination provisions and the need to consider reasonable accommodations.\\n\\nIn summary, the legalization of medical marijuana requires employers to carefully review and potentially update their workplace policies and regulations to ensure they are legally compliant and address the complexities introduced by medical marijuana use among employees. Employers must balance their duty to maintain a safe and productive workplace with the rights of employees who are legally using medical marijuana for medical purposes.\\n \\n --- \\n\\n\\n    Here is additional context relevant to the question:\\n\\n    \\n --- \\n I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing. \\n\\nI\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.\\n\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \\n\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated\\n\\ntrying to build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado\\n\\nI work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.\\n\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons,\\nI just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?  \\n\\nSo to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious. \\n\\nI work for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered. \\n\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return, \\n\\nI’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could write a novel on this, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on anything!\\n\\n\\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to work.\\n\\n\\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to an underlying medical condition \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mI have a hunch that the injury set it off, but idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I pushed through a lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent home from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my hours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They agreed.\\n\\n\\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as communicative as possible about it. \\n\\n\\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours have begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents from a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to start back full time immediately. \\n\\n\\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it conflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about it. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts, that I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their hand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get them the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted to ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very hesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I realized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details about where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.\\n\\n\\\\-2 days later, HR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying to set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them until 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of due to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my condition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\n\\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused. They used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off work as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before, and I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I felt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they wanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one point, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right. They then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to go back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though that makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten sick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s definitely not that simple.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy question is:...do you think my company is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick employee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate this feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with. All I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off. And if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a normal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?\\n\\nI already asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\n\\nMICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlet’s call him Jim\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m shared my text with my boss \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBob\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted\\n“Can you get me in a few”\\n“You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one”\\n“Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬”\\nAt the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride.\\nMy boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in the same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not. \\nHe also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before.\\nIn the end I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.  \\nI would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.\\n\\nHey LegalAdvice,\\n\\nI live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school. \\n\\nI went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDecreasing by .75C/HR\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m was changed without me being told about this change. \\n\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had changed.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this. \\n\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post! \\n\\nThank you guys. \\n\\nMaryland, USA\\nFirst question here, basically title. What do I need to know before I \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32ma highschool student and minor\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough movement organized by the Women\\'s March Group? \\nIn particular I have these questions:\\n\\n-Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently than participators? \\n\\n-How are organizers/participators usually punished?\\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nIf my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?\\n\\nI don’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a r/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m not looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more so for future reference. \\nI’ve done a bit of googling &amp; can’t come up with anything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also feel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3 jobs total, 1 for 2 &amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp; another for like 2-3 months. \\nAwhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp; had to request a day off \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32msome months out\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor was the one that scheduling was dealt with through. \\nI request the day off &amp; tell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment. \\nShe asks me “what kind of doctor?” \\nI was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type of doctor I was going to be seeing. \\nShe then says “I need to know what for.” \\nI feel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I explained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp; she seemed satisfied enough. I got the day off. \\nBasically I’m just curious if this is common practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s not? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp; might be overthinking it altogether. \\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mObligatory apology for mobile formatting\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\n\\nHey there Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells smoking paraphernalia  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mpipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthe two potential areas I would consider operating\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. The closest store I have seen to this was in Toronto\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mclearly not NYC or Nassau County LI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\n\\nI have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take regarding this?\\n\\nI live in South Carolina.\\n\\nI’m sure the reason I can’t find the answer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\n\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of them, though one more than the other. \\n\\nWhen it comes to things like FMLA and the other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include both clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?\\n\\nClinic A has 14 employees, clinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mTuesday Wednesday and Thursday\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\n\\nThank you in advance.\\n\\nHello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but only just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a bit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just due to concerns.\\n\\nJust as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a relatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering the phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in civil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the basement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I performed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to the department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a backup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent reviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I started to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before; secondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a little unhealthy.\\n\\nI should preface this by saying I have several mental health issues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel comfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble with memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and while I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two days. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my previous position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are being counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a year at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal admonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were apparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the same building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take back my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to affirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my supervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either department, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told me that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and that they may have done this in the past.\\n\\nTo try and shorten this all: despite my having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are spreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions. I fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and contact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and fire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have trouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate advice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.\\n\\nI work for a small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to create a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the legality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the position to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the position  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them first, but they would not be best for the company. I am trying to convince her to hire from the outside so that our problems are more likely to be solved. However, I don\\'t want her to do anything illegal that will harm her business.

       "# Key Legal Issues Involving Medical Marijuana and Employment\n",
       "\n",
       "The intersection of medical marijuana legalization and employment law presents a complex array of legal issues for both employers and employees. Below are key points that outline these legal challenges:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana is illegal under federal law but legal for medical use in many states. This creates a conflict for employers who must navigate compliance with both sets of laws, particularly if they are federal contractors or operate in federally regulated industries.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Workplace Drug Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. These policies must be balanced with state laws that may offer protections to medical marijuana users.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Disability Discrimination**: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect the use of federally illegal drugs, but state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. State laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee's legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must handle information about an employee's medical marijuana use confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: Employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship or pose a safety risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Training and Communication**: Employers should provide training to HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace and clearly communicate company policies to employees.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Federal Contracts and Regulations**: Employers with federal contracts must maintain compliance with federal drug-free workplace requirements, which can be at odds with state medical marijuana laws.\n",
       "\n",
       "These points highlight the multifaceted legal issues that arise when medical marijuana intersects with employment law. Employers and employees must navigate these challenges carefully to ensure legal compliance and protect their respective rights and interests."

       "# Key Legal Issues Involving Medical Marijuana and Employment\n",
       "\n",
       "The intersection of medical marijuana legalization and employment law presents a complex array of legal issues for both employers and employees. Below are key points that outline these legal challenges:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Federal vs. State Law Conflicts**: Marijuana is illegal under federal law but legal for medical use in many states. This creates a conflict for employers who must navigate compliance with both sets of laws, particularly if they are federal contractors or operate in federally regulated industries.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Workplace Drug Policies**: Employers often have drug-free workplace policies that prohibit the use of all drugs, including medical marijuana. These policies must be balanced with state laws that may offer protections to medical marijuana users.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Disability Discrimination**: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect the use of federally illegal drugs, but state laws may require employers to accommodate the underlying medical condition for which an employee is using medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Drug Testing**: Employers may conduct drug testing, but the presence of THC in a drug test does not necessarily indicate current impairment. State laws may protect medical marijuana patients from adverse employment actions based solely on a positive drug test.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment, which can be at odds with an employee's legal use of medical marijuana, especially in positions that are considered safety-sensitive.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Employers must handle information about an employee's medical marijuana use confidentially and in compliance with privacy laws.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: The use of medical marijuana can affect claims for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, depending on state law and the circumstances of the drug use in relation to the workplace.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **State-Specific Protections**: Some states have enacted specific protections for medical marijuana patients, prohibiting discrimination based on an individual's status as a medical marijuana patient. Employers in these states must be aware of and comply with these protections.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Employment Contracts**: Employment contracts may include clauses related to drug use and termination for cause. These clauses must be reviewed to ensure they do not conflict with state laws protecting medical marijuana patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Legal Challenges and Litigation**: Employers and employees may find themselves involved in legal disputes over the use of medical marijuana and its impact on employment. Both parties must stay informed about the latest legal developments and seek legal advice when necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Reasonable Accommodation**: In some states, employers may be required to consider reasonable accommodations for employees who are qualified medical marijuana patients, as long as the accommodation does not cause undue hardship or pose a safety risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Training and Communication**: Employers should provide training to HR personnel and managers on how to handle medical marijuana issues in the workplace and clearly communicate company policies to employees.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Federal Contracts and Regulations**: Employers with federal contracts must maintain compliance with federal drug-free workplace requirements, which can be at odds with state medical marijuana laws.\n",
       "\n",
       "These points highlight the multifaceted legal issues that arise when medical marijuana intersects with employment law. Employers and employees must navigate these challenges carefully to ensure legal compliance and protect their respective rights and interests."
