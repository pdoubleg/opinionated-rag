    Query: What are the legal considerations for insurance coverage in cases of professional negligence for architects and engineers?
    Document: """The policy outlines the scope of insurance coverage available to architects and engineers in the event of claims made against them for professional negligence. It specifies the conditions under which the insurer will indemnify the insured against liability incurred as a result of errors, omissions, or negligent acts in the performance of professional services. Key exclusions include claims arising from willful misconduct, known liabilities prior to the policy inception, and contractual liabilities exceeding the scope of standard professional duties. The document further details the process for filing a claim, the insurer's rights to defend or settle claims, and the duty of the insured to cooperate with the insurer in the claims process."""
    Relevant: Yes

    Query: How does the 'sudden and accidental' coverage provision apply to property damage claims in commercial property insurance?
    Document: """This excerpt from a legal journal reviews several landmark cases that have interpreted the 'sudden' provision within commercial property insurance policies. It examines how courts have variously defined 'sudden' â€” with some interpreting it as referring strictly to the timing of the incident (unexpected) and others considering the onset and nature of the damage."""

The document assesses the effectiveness of these models in disaster response and recovery, providing case studies from recent events."""

It discusses various strategies insurance companies are implementing to incentivize environmental responsibility among policyholders, such as offering premium discounts for eco-friendly business operations and integrating sustainability criteria into their risk assessment processes.
