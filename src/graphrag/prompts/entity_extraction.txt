-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [court, plaintiff, defendant, complaint, judgment, securities brokerage firm, investment banking branch, retail sales branch, institutional shareholder, proxy, fairness opinion, fiduciary duty, fraud, vicarious liability, principal-agent relationship, agency relationship, constructive fraud, proximate cause, summary judgment, deposition, engagement letter, fee agreement, investment banking service, acquisition candidate, merger candidate, fairness opinion fee, confidential information, pecuniary loss, physical harm, legal prohibition, intentional tort, acquisition group, hearsay, case law citation, statute]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity

Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Plaintiff, John Prdromos, filed a four-count first amended complaint against defendants, Everen Securities, Inc. (Everen), Principal Financial Securities, Inc. (Principal), Daniel Westrope, and Dennis Klaeser, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and fraud in connection with defendants alleged usurpation of plaintiffs proposed purchase of Home Federal Savings Bank (Home Bank). The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on count I (breach of fiduciary duty) and counts II and IV (fraud) of the first amended complaint, from which plaintiff appeals.
