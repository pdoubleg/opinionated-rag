Paul Alan Levy, Alan B. Morrison, and Allison M. Zieve were on the brief for amicus curiae Public Citizen. Before: GINSBURG, Chief Judge,and ROBERTS, Circuit Judge, and WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge. Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge GINSBURG. GINSBURG, Chief Judge: This case concerns the Recording Industry Association of America’s use of the subpoena provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512 (h), to identify internet users the RIAA believes are infringing the copyrights of its members. The RIAA served two subpoenas upon Verizon Internet Services in order to discover the names of two Verizon subscribers who appeared to be trading large numbers of .mp3 files of copyrighted music via “peer-to-peer” (P2P) file sharing programs, such as KaZaA. Verizon refused to comply with the subpoenas on various legal grounds. The district court rejected Verizon’s statutory and constitutional challenges to § 512(h) and ordered the internet service provider (ISP) to disclose to the RIAA the names of the two subscribers. On appeal Verizon presents three alternative arguments for reversing the orders of the district court: (1) § 512(h) does not authorize the issuance of a subpoena to an ISP acting solely as a conduit for communications the content of which is determined by others; if the statute does authorize such a subpoena, then the statute is unconstitutional because (2) the district court lacked Article III jurisdiction to issue a subpoena with no underlying “case or controversy” pending before the court; and (3) § 512(h) violates the First Amendment because it lacks sufficient safeguards to protect an internet user’s ability to speak and to associate anonymously. Because we agree with Verizon’s interpretation of the statute, we reverse the orders of the district court enforcing the subpoenas and do not reach either of Verizon’s constitutional arguments. * I. Background Individuals with a personal computer and access to the internet began to offer digital copies of recordings for download by other users, an activity known as file sharing, in the late 1990’s using a program called Napster. Although recording companies and music publishers successfully obtained an injunction against Napster’s facilitating the sharing of files containing copyrighted recordings, see A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 284 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.2002); A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir.2001), millions of people in the United States and around the world continue to share digital .mp3 files of copyrighted recordings using P2P computer programs such as KaZaA, Morpheus, Grokster, and eDonkey. See John Borland, File Swapping Shifts Up a Gear (May 27, 2003), available at http:// news.com.com/2100-1026-1009742.html, *88 (last visited December 2, 2003). Unlike Napster, which relied upon a centralized communication architecture to identify the .mp3 files available for download, the current generation of P2P file sharing programs allow an internet user to search directly the .mp3 file libraries of other users; no web site is involved. See Douglas Lichtman & William Landes, Indirect Liability for Copyright Infringement: An Economic Perspective, 16 Harv. J. Law & Tech. 395, 403, 408-09 (2003). To date, owners of copyrights have not been able to stop the use of these decentralized programs. See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 259 F.Supp.2d 1029 (C.D.Cal.2003) (holding Grokster not contributorily liable for copyright infringement by users of its P2P file sharing program). The RIAA now has begun to direct its anti-infringement efforts against individual users of P2P file sharing programs. In order to pursue apparent infringers the RIAA needs to be able to identify the individuals who are sharing and trading files using P2P programs. The RIAA can readily obtain the screen name of an individual user, and using the Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with that screen name, can trace the user to his ISP. Only the ISP, however, can link the IP address used to access a P2P program with the name and address of a person - the ISP’s customer - who can then be contacted or, if need be, sued by the RIAA. The RIAA has used the subpoena provisions of § 512(h) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to compel ISPs to disclose the names of subscribers whom the RIAA has reason to believe are infringing its members’ copyrights. See 17 U.S.C. § 512 (h)(1) (copyright owner may “request the clerk of any United States district court to issue a subpoena to [an ISP] for identification of an alleged infringer”). Some ISPs have complied with the RIAA’s § 512(h) subpoenas and identified the names of the subscribers sought by the RIAA. The RIAA has sent letters to and filed lawsuits against several hundred such individuals, each of whom allegedly made available for download by other users hundreds or in some cases even thousands of .mp3 files of copyrighted recordings. Verizon refused to comply with and instead has challenged the validity of the two § 512(h) subpoenas it has received. A copyright owner (or its agent, such as the RIAA) must file three items along with its request that the Clerk of a district court issue a subpoena: (1) a “notification of claimed infringement” identifying the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed and the infringing material or activity, and providing information reasonably sufficient for the ISP to locate the material, all as further specified in § 512(c)(3)(A); (2) the"

       "| 465 F.3d 1069       | Neutral     | The context revolves around StreamCast's distribution of the Morpheus Software in two versions and their subsequent legal challenges regarding technology for filtering and fingerprinting media files. A key point of legal contention was whether the terms of an injunction met the requirements of Rule 65(d), which pertains to the specificity of injunction terms. The citation 465 F.3d 1069 refers to Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., where the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals provided guidance on the review process for injunctions, specifying that orders granting permanent injunctions are reviewed for abuse of discretion or erroneous application of legal principles. The specificity of the injunction's terms is subject to de novo review, and injunctions under Rule 65(d) are upheld unless they are so vague as to lack any reasonably specific meaning. | Would the standard for reviewing the terms of a permanent injunction against a company found liable for copyright infringement apply similarly as outlined in Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.?, How would the principles outlined in Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., guide the drafting of an injunction order to prevent a company from distributing copyrighted media through software?, In a case where a company argues that an injunction is too vague, how might the reasoning in Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., apply in determining whether the injunction has reasonably specific meaning? | Bates v.

       "| 239 F.3d at 1024    | Neutral     | The context discusses the copyright infringement case involving Grokster and StreamCast, contrasting these companies' operations with Napster’s previous case. It highlights the principle that the right and ability to supervise for vicarious liability does not equate to the duty of entities found liable for copyright infringement to police copyrighted materials. It specifically refers to Napster’s case, where its ability to police was limited by the system's architecture, indicating that mere potential to modify the system does not necessarily imply vicarious liability. Turning a blind eye to infringement for profit could still lead to liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Would a digital marketplace selling user-created content be held vicariously liable for copyright infringement if it has no direct control over the user uploads but profits from the sales?, Would a company that provides cloud storage services be vicariously liable for copyright infringement if users store and share copyrighted materials on the service, assuming the company has implemented no proactive monitoring measures but has the capability to remove infringing content upon notification?                                                                                                 | copyright infringement, vicarious liability, Napster, Grokster, StreamCast, right and ability to supervise, system architecture, turning a blind eye       |\n",
       "| 294 F. Supp. 2d 504 | Neutral     | In Lehman Brothers, Inc. v. Wu, the court addressed the issue of copyright infringement liability concerning third-party contributions. The court held that copyright infringing defendants cannot assert contribution claims against third parties who allegedly contribute to infringement. Furthermore, it established that neither the Copyright Act nor federal common law recognizes a copyright infringer's right to contribution. This ruling plays a significant role in copyright law by denying defendants the ability to shift or spread liability to third parties for copyright infringement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Can defendant X claim that a third party's actions should partially absolve them of copyright infringement liability?, If a seller at a market is found infringing copyright, can the market owner claim that the seller's actions contributively absolve their liability for allowing the sale?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | copyright infringement, third-party contribution, federal common law, Lehman Brothers v.

       "The main arguments on misrepresentations in the case revolve around the credibility of testimony and the trial court's handling of evidence. One argument is that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Dr. Zeeshan Tayeb's testimony, which was considered inadmissible habit evidence under Evid.R. 406, suggesting Dr. Durrani made false statements about the urgency of surgeries (Densler2024 chunk 6). Another contention is the inconsistency between Mr. Densler's deposition and trial testimony regarding Dr. Durrani's warning about paralysis, which was not challenged due to the trial court's refusal to allow cross-examination on this point (Densler2024 chunk 10). Additionally, the trial court's decision to prevent interrogation of a prejudicial comment maker was seen as an abuse of discretion, impacting the jury's fraud conclusion (Densler2024 chunk 11). The Ohio First District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment, citing an abuse of discretion for not allowing cross-examination about prior inconsistent statements in line with Evid.R. 613(B) (Densler2024 chunk 9).\n",
