In fact, the Supreme Court expressly reserved the question of “whether a theory of ‘single business enterprise’ is a necessary <em>addition </em>to Texas law.” <em>See So. Union Co. v. City of Edinburg, </em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/129/74/#p87\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"120\" data-cite=\"129 S.W.3d 74\" data-case-ids=\"9269315\">129 S.W.3d 74</a>, 87 (Tex.2003) (emphasis added); <em>see also SSP Partners, </em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/444/#p456\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"121\" data-cite=\"275 S.W.3d 444\" data-case-ids=\"8210866\">275 S.W.3d at 452</a> (noting that the Texas Supreme Court had never approved of the single business enterprise theory).

The <em>Wortham </em>court, for example, held that a plaintiff could not rely on the theory because the plaintiff had failed to raise it in the trial court, and stated that <em>“[ajssuming Texas law recognizes the single business enterprise theory </em>as a basis for disregarding the corporate fiction, it was appellants’ burden to plead and prove the theory.” <em>Wortham, </em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/179/189/\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"122\" data-cite=\"179 S.W.3d 189\" data-case-ids=\"8995289\">179 S.W.3d at 196</a> (emphasis added); <em>see also, e.g., Nat’l Plan Adm’rs, </em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/150/718/#p744\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"123\" data-cite=\"150 S.W.3d 718\" data-case-ids=\"9189403\">150 S.W.3d at 744</a> (“The supreme court has not spoken on the issue of the viability of the single-business-enterprise theory.”) (citing <em>Edinburg, </em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/129/74/#p87\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"124\" data-cite=\"129 S.W.3d 74\" data-case-ids=\"9269315\">129 S.W.3d at 87</a>); <em>Carlson Mfg., Inc. v.

AAI sent its letter requesting an appeal on December 13, 2006. On the one hand, it is significant that the deadline to file an appeal did not expire until December 20, 2006 — -a week after AAI requested the appeal. On the other hand, it must be noted that the underlying court of appeals’ decision in <em>SSP Partners </em>did not address the general viability of the single business enterprise theory so as to provide clear and express notice that the Supreme Court would reach the issue. <em>See SSP Partners v.

Further, making an <em>Erie </em>guess, the Court holds that there is no <em>per se </em>rule that an insurer’s duty to defend does not encompass a duty to appeal an adverse judgment against the insured. Rather, in the absence of a policy provision to the contrary, an insurer does have the duty to appeal where there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.

The insurance policy in issue provided that the duty to defend ended when the applicable policy limits were exhausted. <em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/601/#p611\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"133\" data-cite=\"114 S.W.3d 601\" data-case-ids=\"9089751\">Id.</a> </em>The <em>Waffle House </em>court held that this was an unambiguous statement of the conditions that terminated the duty. <em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/601/#p611\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"134\" data-cite=\"114 S.W.3d 601\" data-case-ids=\"9089751\">Id.</a> </em>Therefore, the court concluded that the duty to defend in that case \"continue[d] through the appellate process until the <a id=\"p724\" href=\"#p724\" data-label=\"724\" data-citation-index=\"1\" class=\"page-label\">*724</a>applicable limits of the policy are exhausted according to the terms of the policy.” <em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/601/#p611\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"135\" data-cite=\"114 S.W.3d 601\" data-case-ids=\"9089751\">Id.</a> </em>Notably, the insurer merely argued that it had no duty to defend the relevant claims at all. <em><a href=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/114/601/#p611\" class=\"citation\" data-index=\"136\" data-cite=\"114 S.W.3d 601\" data-case-ids=\"9089751\">Id.</a> </em>In this context, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals’ two paragraph, ambiguous discussion of the duty to defend continuing through the \"appellate process” until the limits of the policy were exhausted is not dispositive of whether insurers have a duty to appeal an adverse decision against their insured in Texas.</p>\\n    </aside>\\n    <aside data-label=\"14\" class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote_1_14\">\\n      <a href=\"#ref_footnote_1_14\">14</a>\\n      <p id=\"b764-8\" data-blocks=\\'[[\"BL_764.8\",764,[996,2578,742,75]]]\\'>. <em>See Erie R.R.

(Cunningham) sued its liability insurer, Universal Underwriters (Universal), alleging Universal breached its duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by a third party. After Cunningham and Universal each moved for summary judgment, the court denied Universal\\'s motion, granted Cunningham\\'s motion, and entered judgment in Cunningham\\'s favor for $197,837.59 plus costs. Universal appeals.</p>\\n<p>We conclude the undisputed facts establish the absence of a potential for coverage under the relevant insurance policies and therefore Universal had no duty to defend Cunningham in the underlying action. Thus, the trial court erred in granting Cunningham summary judgment and in denying Universal\\'s summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for the court to enter summary judgment in Universal\\'s favor.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>FACTUAL SUMMARY</h2>\\n<p>This case concerns whether Universal had a duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by Steven Beus and his limited liability company (collectively Beus). Beus\\'s complaint alleged the following:</p>\\n<p>In April 1996, Beus met with a real estate agent representing Cunningham regarding potential sites for an Isuzu dealership. The agent showed Beus property owned by Cunningham located on Johnson Avenue in El Cajon (the Johnson property). The Johnson property consisted of a front lot and a rear lot. \"The rear lot was `improved\\' with dilapidated and unsightly ... buildings.\" The front lot was improved with structures appropriate for use as an automobile dealership. Cunningham\\'s real estate agent told Beus that the tenant on the front lot, Holland Motor Homes, would vacate the premises in late November or early December.</p>\\n<p>In September 1996, Beus and Cunningham entered into a written lease agreement pertaining to the Johnson property. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> Although the agreement specifically provided that the January 1, 1997 lease commencement date was \"subject to ... Holland ... vacating the Premises,\" Beus alleged that \"the true intent of the parties was that the lease commencement date could be made earlier, but not later, than January 1, 1997.\"</p>\\n<p>In reliance on representations that Holland would be vacating the property no later than January 1, 1997, Beus expended funds to open the dealership on that date, including entering into agreements with the local redevelopment agency, obtaining loans from Isuzu, and paying for the demolition of the buildings on the rear lot. Beus also ordered an inventory of new Isuzu vehicles to be delivered to the new dealership.</p>\\n<p>While waiting to occupy the main portion of the lot, Beus moved into the vacant back lot, and stored the new Isuzu vehicles at this lot. On December 28, 1996, Beus representatives attempted to take possession of the front portion of the lot. But Holland representatives said that Holland would not vacate the premises for another two weeks. In the succeeding six weeks, Beus made numerous demands for possession of the front portion of the Johnson property, receiving in return a series of promises and representations from Cunningham and others that Holland would vacate the premises by certain dates. Meanwhile, Beus attempted to \"operate out of a damp, tin building remaining on the rear lot portion of the premises with no phones, no electricity, and no plumbing.\" Because of its inability to move into the front lot, Beus was unable to obtain a sales license from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and thus was unable to generate any revenue.</p>\\n<p>Six weeks later, on February 18, 1997, Holland finally vacated the Johnson property, and Cunningham delivered full possession of the premises to Beus. During the next year, Beus remained in possession of the property and operated the dealership.</p>\\n<p>In February 1998, approximately one year after opening the dealership, Beus was \"forced to close the doors\" of the business and move out of the property. Beus then sued Cunningham and several others, alleging that Cunningham\\'s late delivery of the premises caused the dealership to \"fail[ ] to be profitable.\" Beus claimed the late delivery caused substantial additional losses, including the inability to take full advantage of the dealership incentive programs, interest charges on the new vehicle credit line, six weeks in salary paid to employees who could not productively perform their services, lease payments on the computer system, and loss of good will, new and used car sales, and working capital. Beus asserted five substantive causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; and (5) intentional interference with contractual relations.</p>\\n<p>Cunningham tendered the defense to Universal, which denied the tender. Cunningham eventually settled the action with Beus for $80,000. Cunningham then brought an action against Universal, alleging that Universal had a duty to defend because there was potential coverage under the policy\\'s personal injury wrongful eviction coverage and property damage coverage. Both parties filed summary judgment motions. The trial court entered judgment in Cunningham\\'s favor, determining there was a potential for coverage under the personal injury provision of Universal\\'s insurance policy, and Universal was thus responsible for $117,837.59 reflecting Cunningham\\'s underlying defense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> costs and $80,000 reflecting the underlying settlement amount.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>I. <i>Generally Applicable Legal Principles</i>\\n</h2>\\n<p>A \"party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that [the party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" (<i>Aguilar v.

The scope of the duty does not depend on the labels given to the causes of action in the third party complaint; instead it rests on whether the <i>alleged facts</i> or <i>Mown extrinsic facts</i> reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. (See <i>Hurley Construction Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> (1992) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>.) In determining the existence of a duty to defend on a summary judgment motion, we conduct a de novo review. (<i>Lomes v. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.</i> (2001) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span>, 131, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280652\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280652/lomes-v-hartford-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

With respect to each type of coverage, we begin by examining the language of the insurance policy, and then we determine whether the allegations of Beus\\'s complaint (and any relevant extrinsic evidence) show a potential for coverage under the relevant policy provisions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>A. <i>Personal Injury Coverage</i>\\n</h2>\\n<p>The personal injury coverage under Cunningham\\'s policy states that Universal will pay all sums that Cunningham is required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> to pay as damages \"because of INJURY.\" The policy defines \"`INJURY\\' \" to include \"false arrest, false imprisonment, <i>wrongful eviction,</i> wrongful detention, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, defamation of character, private nuisance (except pollution), and <i>invasion of rights of privacy or possession of personal property.</i>\" (Italics added.) As with most forms of personal injury liability insurance, the coverage does not require an \"`accidental occurrence,\\' \" and instead \"`... is triggered by one of the offenses listed in the policy.\\' [Citation.] Although the offenses enumerated in a policy are construed broadly when they are defined in generic terms, they encompass `\"... specific torts which <i>reasonably</i> could fall within the general category.\" [Citation.]\\'\" (<i>Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. Co.</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></span>, 1263, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p>Tendering the defense of the Beus action, Cunningham claimed it was potentially covered under the wrongful eviction category of personal injury. In its summary judgment motion, Universal argued that wrongful eviction presupposes the injured party was removed or ousted from real property, and there was nothing in Beus\\'s complaint or the extrinsic facts to show a removal or ouster allegedly occurred in this case. Cunningham countered that a wrongful eviction claim within the meaning of the policy includes not only a removal from real property but also encompasses other forms of interference with a party\\'s present or future right to use the property. The trial court adopted this definition.</p>\\n<p>In resolving these conflicting interpretations of the phrase \"wrongful eviction,\" we apply settled rules of insurance policy construction. As with any contract, the goal of insurance policy interpretation \"is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.\" (<i>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S.</i> (2001) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525331/safeco-ins-co-of-america-v-robert-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 763, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525331/safeco-ins-co-of-america-v-robert-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In so doing, we must \"look first to the language of the [insurance policy] in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.\" (<i>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 11 Cal.4th at p. 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158522/waller-v-truck-ins-exchange-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

If the policy provision is unambiguous, i.e., has only one reasonable construction, it must be interpreted according to this plain meaning. (<i>Ray v. Valley Forge Ins. Co.</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></span>, 1044, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span>.) But if a policy provision is ambiguous, the ambiguous terms \"`are resolved in the insureds\\' favor, consistent with the insureds\\' reasonable expectations.\\'\" (<i>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">S.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 26 Cal.4th at p. 761, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525331/safeco-ins-co-of-america-v-robert-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525331/safeco-ins-co-of-america-v-robert-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p>Under these principles, we look first at the plain meaning of a wrongful eviction. The term \"evict\" means \"[t]o expel ... by legal process; put out\"; \"[t]o force out; eject; dispossess\"; \"[t]o recover (property, for example) by a superior claim or legal process.\" (Am. Heritage Diet, (new college ed.1981) pp. 454-55.) These dictionary definitions comport with the commonly understood meaning of the word\\x97an eviction requires that a person first be in actual possession of real property, and then be removed from that property. (See <i>Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1265, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span> </span>[\"an eviction, popularly understood, is necessarily from <i>somewhere\"].</i>) The legal definition of an eviction is the same: an \"eviction\" is \"[t]he act or process of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.\" (Black\\'s Law Diet. (7th ed. 1999) p. 575, col. 2.) A <i>wrongful</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> eviction thus occurs when the person recovering the property had no right to dispossess the other party from the property.</p>\\n<p>Applying this plain meaning of the policy language, Beus\\'s claims against Cunningham do not reasonably fall within the category of a wrongful eviction. The undisputed facts show that Beus\\'s claims against Cunningham centered solely on Beus\\'s inability to <i>take</i> possession of the front portion of the Johnson property. There was nothing in the complaint or the extrinsic evidence supporting a claim or the possibility of a claim that Cunningham <i>removed or expelled</i> Beus from any portion of the property. On this record, there was no potential for personal injury coverage under Cunningham\\'s policy.</p>\\n<p>Cunningham\\'s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\\n<p>Cunningham first argues that courts have expanded the phrase \"wrongful eviction\" beyond its commonly understood meaning to include \"any claims of disturbance with the tenant\\'s [potential] right of possession.\" We agree that if an insurance policy term has been judicially construed, this construction should be read into the policy unless the parties express a contrary intent. (See <i>Bartlome v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> (1989) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></span>, 1239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144332/bartlome-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>.) But the predicate of Cunningham\\'s argument is missing. Cunningham has not cited, and our independent research has not disclosed, any reported decision that has interpreted the language of the wrongful eviction provision in the policy before us to encompass claims for interference with future or existing property rights.</p>\\n<p>To show courts have interpreted the \"wrongful eviction\" phrase beyond its commonly understood meaning, Cunningham relies on <i>General Accident Ins. Co. v. West American Ins. Co.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In that case, the underlying plaintiff managed an insurance agency and leased the premises occupied by the agency.

After the partnership entities (the insureds) terminated his contract and \"`ousted\\'\" him from the premises, the plaintiff sued the insureds alleging wrongful termination, breach of contract, and tortious interference. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 99-100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The first policy provided coverage for \"injury arising out of `wrongful entry or eviction, <i>or other invasion of the right of private occupancy</i>\\' committed in the conduct of the insured\\'s business.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 103, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The <i>General Accident</i> court found there <i>was</i> coverage under this provision because the insured invaded the injured party\\'s right of private occupancy. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>.) In so concluding, the court noted in dicta that the phrase \"`\"<i>other invasion of the right of private occupancy</i>\"\\'\" did not require a <i>physical invasion</i> of an interest in real property. (<i>Ibid.,</i> italics added.)<sup>[1]</sup> The second insurance policy provided coverage for personal injury arising out of \"`[w]rongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies....\\'\" (<i>General <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Accident,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Stating that this provision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> \"narrows the definition of this particular offense\" to \"`some physical act of eviction or entry upon premises,\\'\" the court found a potential for coverage under this policy, emphasizing that the third party plaintiffs complaint alleged that the insured entities had \"ousted\" him from the property and interfered with his right to occupy the premises. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 104-105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p><i>General Accident</i> does not support an expanded definition of the phrase \"wrongful eviction\" in the policy before us. The first <i>General Accident</i> insurance policy contained the additional <i>\"`or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\\'\"</i> phrase that is not included in the Universal policy. (<i>General <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Accident,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 42 Cal.App.4th at p. 103, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, italics added.) The Universal policy instead specifically limits the \"invasion\" of property rights coverage to \"personal property\" interests, which are necessarily limited to claims such as conversion or damage to personal property. (See <i>ante,</i> at pp. 167-168.) Although the second <i>General Accident</i> insurance policy contained policy language that was closer to Universal\\'s policy language because it did not include the \"other invasion of the right to private occupancy\" phrase, the court\\'s analysis is inapplicable here because the insured in that case had <i>physically ousted</i> the underlying plaintiff from his business premises. (See <i>Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v. Home Indemnity Co.</i> (1998) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249141\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249141/stein-brief-group-v-home-indem-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Here, there were no similar facts showing Cunningham made any attempt to oust or eject Beus from any portion of the property.</p>\\n<p>Cunningham alternatively attempts to show a broad judicial construction by directing us to the line of cases holding a wrongful eviction in a CGL policy includes a constructive eviction. (See <i>Legarra v. Federated Mutual Ins. Co.</i> (1995) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1472</span></span>, 1484, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This argument is not helpful because even if Universal policy\\'s personal injury coverage could be construed to include this legal meaning of a wrongful eviction, there are no facts showing the possibility of a constructive eviction claim in this case.</p>\\n<p>An eviction is actual when a landlord takes direct action to physically expel the tenant from the premises. An eviction is constructive if the landlord engages in acts that render the premises unfit for occupancy for the purpose for which it was leased, or deprive the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises. (<i>Kulawitz v. Pacific etc. Paper Co.</i> (1944) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span>, 670, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>; <i>Sanders v.

Cunningham contends that Beus\\'s complaint potentially supports a constructive eviction claim because Beus alleged it took possession of the rear portion of the Johnson property and this portion of the property was in an unsatisfactory condition for use as a car dealership.</p>\\n<p>This argument is unavailing because there are no allegations or extrinsic evidence showing that the condition of the rear lot had anything to do with the damages allegedly suffered by Beus. Beus did not seek any damages regarding the condition of the back lot; instead Beus\\'s requested damages related solely to its inability to move into the front portion of the lot on the lease commencement date. To establish a potential for coverage under the Universal policy\\'s personal injury coverage, Cunningham was required to show <span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> the third party\\'s claimed damages were allegedly <i>caused</i> by the wrongful eviction. Cunningham did not, and could not, satisfy this element with respect to the condition of the rear lot.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, any claims regarding the condition of the rear lot cannot constitute a constructive eviction claim because it is undisputed that Beus never vacated this portion of the lot, and instead remained in possession of the entire property until Beus closed the business one year later. \"In order that there be a constructive eviction it is essential that the tenant should vacate the property. There is no constructive eviction if the tenant continues in possession of the premises however much he may be disturbed in the beneficial enjoyment.\" (<i>Lori, Ltd. v.

(See <i>Lee v. Placer Title Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

While a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is similar to a constructive eviction claim, the critical difference is that the latter claim may not be brought until the tenant has vacated the property. (See <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182285/green-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Green,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 10 Cal.3d at p. 625, fn. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1182285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1182285/green-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In support, Cunningham quotes from the July 1985 Fire Casualty &amp; Surety Bulletin (Bulletin) as follows: \"`<i>Wrongful eviction can be anything done by a landlord or his agent that is intended to and results in the tenant being deprived of use, occupancy, or enjoyment of all or part of the leased premises.</i>\\'\" (Italics added.) Cunningham maintains this interpretation establishes that the phrase \"wrongful eviction\" was intended to include all forms of interference with a tenant\\'s existing or future property rights.</p>\\n<p>We agree that a definition of an insurance term contained in an insurance industry bulletin may be relevant to defeat an insurer\\'s contention that the term in a standard commercial liability policy should be more narrowly construed. (See <i>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Reeder</i> (1990) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></span>, 972-973, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2126249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2126249/maryland-casualty-co-v-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>.) However, the Bulletin was not part of the evidentiary record below. It was not proffered by either party in support or opposition to the summary judgment motions, and instead was cited only in Cunningham\\'s summary judgment briefs. \"`[W]hen reviewing the correctness of a trial court\\'s judgment, an appellate court will consider only matters which were part of the record at the time the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> judgment was entered.\\'\" (<i>Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc.</i> (1996) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160464\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160464/vons-companies-inc-v-seabest-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 444, fn. 3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The language quoted in Cunningham\\'s appellate brief comes from one of these paragraphs, which merely paraphrases and does not purport to quote from the Bulletin. This material was therefore of no help in construing the policy language before us.</p>\\n<p>Several weeks later, Cunningham notified us that it had finally obtained a copy of the Bulletin and submitted excerpts of that Bulletin to this court. Even assuming we could properly consider this evidence, it does not support Cunningham\\'s position. Most significantly, the Bulletin makes clear that its discussion is limited to the pre-1986 version of the standard wrongful eviction coverage. As recognized by two California appellate courts, in 1985 a broad form of the standard wrongful eviction clause (\"wrongful entry or eviction, <i>or other invasion of the right of private occupancy</i>\") was in effect, but this version was narrowed by the Insurance Services Organization as part of the 1986 standard form comprehensive general liability policy. (<i>General <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Accident,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>.) The post-1985 standard policies no longer included the \"or other invasion of the right of private occupancy\" clause. (<i>General <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Accident,</span> supra</a></span>,</i> 42 Cal.App.4th at p. 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258291/general-accident-ins-co-v-west-am-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p>The relevant personal injury coverage at issue here is materially different from the pre-1986 version discussed in the Bulletin. Universal\\'s policy provides coverage only for wrongful eviction, and does not include the \"<i>other</i> invasion of the right of private occupancy\" language of the pre-1985 standard policies. Thus, we cannot assume that the version of the policy language discussed in the Bulletin was equivalent to the policy language before us. Further, the Bulletin refers to the Ballentine\\'s Law Dictionary as the source of its definitions of policy language. Ballentine\\'s Law Dictionary defines \"eviction\" as a \"[dispossession, actual or constructive,\" including a \"disturbance of [a tenant\\'s] possession, ... depriving him of the enjoyment of the demised premise, or any portion thereof, by title paramount or by entry and act of the landlord.\" (Ballentine\\'s Law Diet. (3d ed.1969) p. 424, col. 1.) Cunningham\\'s alleged failure to timely deliver possession to Beus does not fit into these definitions.</p>\\n<p>An \"insurer\\'s duty to defend is not absolute but is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy.\" (<i>Rosen v. Nations Title Ins. Co.</i> (1997) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></span>.) Thus, our focus must be on \"the language of the policy itself, not upon `general\\' rules of coverage that are not necessarily responsive to the policy language.\" (<i>American Cyanamid Co. v. American Home Assurance Co.</i> (1994) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Further, although we must resolve any doubt as to whether the facts establish a defense duty in the insured\\'s favor, \"[w]e may not impose coverage by adopting a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.\" (<i>Rosen v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> <i>Nations Title Ins. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 56 Cal.

Even assuming we could construe Beus\\'s complaint to potentially allege an occurrence, there is no possibility of coverage because Beus did not allege covered property damage.</p>\\n<p>The Universal policy\\'s property damage provision covered only those claims alleging \"damage to or loss of use of <i>tangible</i> property.\" (Italics added.)

(<i>Id.</i> at pp. 881, 880, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>.) Applying this principle, the <i>Kazi</i> court held the loss of use of an easement did not qualify as property damage because an easement is an intangible property right more akin to the loss of an investment than fee simple property ownership. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 880, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585557/kazi-v-state-farm-fire-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p>Under these principles, Cunningham\\'s claim for a defense under Universal\\'s property damage provision fails. Beus\\'s claimed loss concerned solely an intangible property right\\x97the interference with its right to possession of real property under the parties\\' lease. A tenant\\'s right to possess property on the lease commencement date is a contractual right that does not mature into a property right until possession actually occurs. A landlord\\'s failure to deliver possession of the premises merely gives the tenant a right to abandon the tenancy and sue for damages, but does not give the tenant the legal right to act as a possessor of the real property until the date of the actual transfer. A nonpossessing tenant has no greater possessory property rights than does an easement holder. In this regard, Cunningham\\'s reliance on <i>Hendrickson v. Zurich American Ins. Co.</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2293434\"><a href=\"/opinion/2293434/hendrickson-v-zurich-american-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span> </a></span>is misplaced because the injured parties in that case were in full possession of the property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> claimed to have been damaged by the insured\\'s tortious conduct.</p>\\n<p>We further reject Cunningham\\'s argument that Beus alleged covered property damage by asserting that Cunningham\\'s tortious conduct caused Beus to suffer a \"loss of use\" of personal property, i.e., the inventory of the new vehicles. Cunningham\\'s claimed failure to deliver the real property on the commencement date did not cause a \"loss of use\" of the vehicles within any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. At most, Cunningham\\'s alleged conduct caused economic damages relating to the inability to use the land to sell the vehicles. This does not reflect covered property damage within the meaning of the policy. (See <i>Continental Casualty Co. v. Superior Court</i> (2001) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span>, 443, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269810/continental-casualty-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>.)</p>\\n<p>Because Beus\\'s complaint alleged only an intangible economic loss, it did not constitute the type of \"loss of use\" property damage necessary to trigger coverage under the property damage policy provisions.

A contrary conclusion would provide a landlord with liability coverage in every tenant holdover case where the succeeding tenant alleges a breach of the commencement date\\x97a result that could not have been envisioned when the landlord purchased liability coverage for <i>property damage.</i> Where, as here, the \"fundamental nature of [the] transactions [between the parties] is economic,\" an insurer generally does not have a duty to defend \"even though the litigation will encompass issues relating to property damage.\" (<i>Continental Casualty Company v. Superior <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Court,</span> supra</span>,</i> 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 443, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269810/continental-casualty-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The matter is remanded for the trial court to vacate its order granting summary judgment to Cunningham, and to enter summary judgment in Universal\\'s favor.

David, who was intoxicated. The plaintiff, Zachary Zaunbrecher, filed a suit alleging that David lost control of his vehicle due to his intoxication after being overserved at Paragon Casino Resort, where Marissa Martin served him alcohol, and security guards Nathan Ponthier and Jeremy Ponthieux failed to prevent him from driving away in an intoxicated state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The trial court dismissed claims against Paragon Casino based on tribal sovereign immunity but was reversed on appeal for the employee defendants.

Subsequently, Talbot settled a lawsuit against a third-party tortfeasor without his employer's approval and his benefits were terminated. He paid a sum to 'buy back' his right to future benefits under La.R.S. 23:1102(B), leading to disputes about the sufficiency of the 'buy-back' and future benefit credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Talbot filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted by the workers' compensation judge (WCJ), thus ruling in his favor. This affirmed that he had fulfilled the 'buy-back' and was entitled to future benefits. Mouton and Liberty Mutual disputed the calculations and appealed. The appellate court reviewed the WCJ's rulings, addressed calculation errors, and remanded the case for further determinations.                                                                   | La.R.S. 23:1102(B) states that an employee forfeits future workers' compensation benefits if settlement of a tort claim with a third party is not approved by the employer or insurer. The right to future benefits can be reserved upon 'buy-back' payment to the employer or insurer, which should not exceed fifty percent of the total recovery minus legal fees.                                                                                                   | The court considered previous cases, including City of Dequincy v. Henry and Mercer v. Nabors Drilling USA, L.P., and rulings that clarified the proper calculation of the 'buy back' amount and the credit against future benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The court de novo reviewed errors in legal analysis by the WCJ and corrected the 'buy back' payment amount and the overpayment credit due to Talbot. It upheld that Talbot's payment satisfied the 'buy-back' provision and ruled that the calculation of future credit owed by Talbot requires reconsideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The court affirmed parts of the WCJ's ruling, amended parts regarding overpayment and 'buy back' figures, and reversed the awarding of dollar for dollar credit. The case is remanded for proper determination of the credit.                                                                                                  | Partially Talbot, with other issues remanded for further proceedings                                           |\n",

A settlement of $120,000 was reached, which included a Medicare Set-Aside Agreement (MSA) requiring CMS approval. The settlement was conditioned on CMS approval, with the benefits amount to be adjusted accordingly. Ms. Ortega filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement and for penalties and attorney fees, asserting nonpayment within thirty days post-agreement violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The settlement was judicially approved, but when CMS did not approve the MSA, Ms. Ortega filed motions for enforcement, penalties, and attorney fees. Upon denial at the WCJ level, she appealed, also filing a Motion to Strike parts of the Appellees' brief for lacking record support. The appellate court affirmed the WCJ's judgment but granted the Motion to Strike.                                                                                                                 | Louisiana Revised Statutes 23:1201(G) pertains to penalties and attorney fees for nonpayment of workers' compensation settlements within thirty days of a final, nonappealable judgment. Louisiana Civil Codes articles 1767, 1768, and 1770 address suspensive conditions in contracts, defining the fulfillment events and nullification conditions dependent on the obligor's actions.                                                                               | The case of Harrelson v. Arcadia established that CMS approval for MSA funding is a suspensive condition delaying the payment obligation until approval. CMS's actions are typically out of the employer's control, negating penalties for delayed payment pending CMS approval.                                                                                                                                                             | The court found no error with the WCJ's determination that the CMS approval was a suspensive condition and that it was not dependent on the whim of the obligor, as the timing and decision of CMS approval lay beyond the employer's control. The court concluded that nonpayment was the result of conditions over which the employer had no control, and therefore statutory penalties and attorney fees were not warranted.                                                                                                       | The appellate court affirmed the WCJ's judgment denying Ms. Ortega's Motion to Enforce Settlement and for penalties and attorney fees, as the settlement was properly conditioned upon CMS approval of the MSA, a suspensive condition.

Hicks and his insurer, GoAuto, claiming damages from a collision where Blanchard's patrol car was rear-ended by a truck owned by Mr. Hicks and insured by GoAuto. The truck was earlier stolen by an unknown thief who abandoned it in gear, causing it to collide with Blanchard's vehicle.

She reached settlements with the responsible parties and their insurers, but pursued claims against her uninsured motorist insurer, Allstate Insurance Company.

The adequacy of damages is reviewed under the manifest error standard, as established by past case law.                    | The appellate court found the trial court did not err in its rulings. Ms. Gaspard did not properly secure her right to a jury trial and did not preserve her recusal argument for appeal. The damage awards were within the trial court's discretion, and there was no error in its determinations related to damages and lost earning capacity.

Adams was awarded SEB, penalties, and attorney fees by the WCJ.

Graphic Packaging International, Inc.' case that occupational noise-induced hearing loss is an occupational disease under the LWCA. 'Poissenot v. St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office' and 'Seal v.

Georgia Gulf failed to prove job availability within Adams' restrictions. The award of penalties and attorney fees was upheld due to Georgia Gulf's arbitrary handling of the claim.

They alleged the crane was unreasonably dangerous due to inadequate warning, design defects, and defects in construction. Their employer, BWW, and its insurer intervened, alleging property damage. Defendants contended that the accident was caused by misuse and overloading of the crane, and not due to defects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The trial court consolidated the suits, denied Manitowoc's motion for summary judgment, granted partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs'/Intervenors, and denied Manitowoc's motions to dismiss and for sanctions due to spoliation of evidence.

For a failure to warn claim, a product is considered unreasonably dangerous if it possessed a characteristic that may cause damage, and the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care to provide an adequate warning. | The Court considered precedents such as Butz v. Lynch and the statutory provisions of La.R.S. 9:2800.54 and related articles for assessing product liability claims under the LPLA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The Court found genuine issues of material fact as to whether the boom was a \"suspended load,\" whether the crane was overloaded or poorly maintained, and if there were feasible alternative designs that could have prevented the incident. It also considered whether the manufacturer performed its duty to warn effectively, looking at alternatives like direct notifications to owners vs. communicating through distributors.                                                                                                  | The appellate court reverses the lower court's judgment granting partial summary judgment on the failure to warn and dismisses affirmative defenses against distributors and previous owners.

Sedano, involved in the listing, ceased working for Vanek and assured Robertson the listing expired. After the property sale, Sedano was paid a commission. Sedano then filed a partial summary judgment to dismiss Vanek's claims, contending Vanek waived his right to a commission in a previous agreement, which Vanek disputed. | Suit filed by Vanek against Robertson; Robertson filed answer, reconventional demand, and third-party demand against Sedano; Sedano moved for partial summary judgment dismissing Vanek's claims, asserting a waiver of commission.

The court found that all claims against SMEDA were dismissed and that the granting of summary judgment in SMEDA's favor was proper.                                                                                                                                                  | The appellate court affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of SMEDA, thereby dismissing with prejudice all claims from Liberty Mutual and Hanover.                                                                                                                                                   | St. Martin Economic Development Authority (SMEDA)                                                              |\n",
       "| James Guilbeau, Keith Antoine, and Clyde Guillory v. Morlon Chaddrick, Utility Lines Construction Services, Inc., and Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company | Whether the trial court erred in granting Plaintiffs a partial summary judgment on liability and making the factual finding that Defendant Morlon Chaddrick was 100% at fault for causing the vehicular accident, despite the contention of numerous issues of material fact as to the negligence and/or comparative fault of the parties in this case.                                                                 | On September 5, 2014, a rear-end collision occurred when Morlon Chaddrick, employed by Utility Lines Construction Services, Inc., struck a stopped St. Landry Parish maintenance truck occupied by Plaintiffs James Guilbeau, Keith Antoine, and Clyde Guillory. St. Landry Parish Government intervened for reimbursement of worker's compensation benefits. The Plaintiffs and Intervenor sought summary judgment on liability, which the trial court granted, reserving issues of medical causation and damages for trial. Defendants appealed, contending the trial court erred by not recognizing the genuine issues of material fact.                                                          | Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on liability, which the trial court granted, finding Defendants 100% at fault. The issues of medical causation and damages were reserved for a trial on the merits. Defendants appealed the decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Louisiana Civil Code Article 2315 outlines general negligence principles requiring proof of duty, breach of duty, cause-in-fact, legal causation, and actual damages. La.R.S. 32:81(A) and 32:141 dictate motorist conduct regarding following distance and parking on highways. Comparative fault principles apply when multiple parties contribute to an accident.                                                                                                    | Garcia v. Stalsby (rear-end collision presumption), Graffia v. Louisiana Farm Bureau (comparative fault in rear-end collisions), Samuel v. Vicknair (application of La.R.S. 32:141), and Laird v. Travelers Ins. Co. (La.R.S. 32:141 as a highway safety measure). The Supreme Court cases of Maggio v. Parker and Boyance v. United Fire and Casualty Co. clarify the roles of the courts in summary judgment and comparative fault.        | The appellate court concluded that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the negligence or comparative fault of the Plaintiffs, notably the parking position of the dump truck and the failure to use safety warnings, as well as the claimed temporary blindness of Mr. Chaddrick due to sun glare. It held that La.R.S. 32:141 applies to a parish road and found that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment without resolving fact-based inquiries, thus reversing and remanding for trial on those issues. | The appellate court reversed the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment finding Defendants 100% at fault and remanded the case for further proceedings.                                                                                                                                                               | Defendants/Appellants                                                                                          |\n",

The WCJ granted summary judgment in favor of Alliance and denied Mitchell's subsequent motion for new trial.
