       "Your inquiry about the legality of being fired for smoking medical marijuana intersects with several of the provided search results, shedding light on aspects of your situation through comparison. The legality of such actions by employers often hinges on state law, company policy, and the specific circumstances of the medical marijuana use, such as whether it impacts work performance or violates a zero-tolerance drug policy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The closest comparison can be made with the case of an individual in Arizona questioning whether their company's zero tolerance drug policy, which dismisses state legalization of marijuana, could override state laws allowing medical marijuana. This case underscores the tension between state laws that legalize medical marijuana and employer policies that may not recognize these laws [[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e8y7gr/considering_getting_a_medical_marijuana_card/)]. In Arizona, where medical marijuana is legal, the individual's concern about the legality of an employer's actions against medical marijuana use, particularly in non-driving office positions, mirrors the broader concerns about employers' rights to enforce drug policies against state law.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another relevant case involves a medical marijuana patient in New York facing discrimination from a new hospital employer after disclosing their patient status during a pre-employment physical. This scenario illustrates the potential for discrimination based on medical marijuana use and the ambiguous legality of such actions by employers [[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gr4q8s/is_it_legal_in_new_york_to_discriminate_against/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "A Pennsylvania inquiry touches on concerns about failing a drug test for medical marijuana during the employment process, highlighting the legal and personal implications of drug testing for medical marijuana users in the workplace [[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gnrqby/if_i_have_a_medical_marijuana_card_can_i_be_fired/)]. This case, like yours, deals with the tension between medical necessity and workplace drug policies.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, your situation resonates with instances where the legality of firing an employee for medical marijuana use is questioned. These cases illustrate the complex interplay between state law, which may protect medical marijuana use, and employer policies that may enforce stricter drug use standards. The analyses suggest that the outcome can significantly depend on jurisdictional interpretations of rights, discrimination laws, and the specifics of employer policies.\n",
