       "This will be a long post, but I really need some advice.\n",
       "\n",
       "I live in Missouri and moved in with my boyfriend in 2005 after his dad moved out, so we've been on a month by month basis since then. We've always had problems, like things not being fixed or disruptive neighbors (screaming all hours of the night, cops and CPS, shared backyard taken over by boats, firepits, toys)  and we're pretty sure they've been in our apartment when we're not there. A long term (20+ years) tenant said they would do this, and other tenants who I was friendly with said they thought the same. I'm pretty sure my landlord stole a bong from me, since he was outside when we left and I hid it, and he and it was gone when we got back. We tore the place apart, but it's never turned up, and that was years ago. I've also thought numerous times that things in my drawers have been rearranged, and a few of my other neighbors over the years have said the same.\n",
       "\n",
       "They have always been slow to fix things, if at all, and several things are broken: windows don't shut, bad wiring leading to lights not working (bathroom and second bedroom), one of the water knobs in the bathroom broke off so we use pliers to turn it, the oven, it goes on and on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the summer we received an undated letter raising rent (they are dated when they would raise rent previously) and it also stated that ANY repairs done to the apartment would raise rent, and it specifically mentioned refrigerators and furnaces. Now, when my boyfriend moved in with his dad back in 2004, the landlord said he knew the furnace needed to be replaced, and was waiting for the furnace to go out before doing it. Three days after getting this letter, our furnace died, so we had no AC over the summer with my boyfriend prone to heat stroke since he's had it three times, and no heat this winter, although it hasn't been too bad with space heaters and electric blankets. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now the new problem is admittedly partially my fault. Rent is due on the first, but I was so busy (I work two jobs and they won't let me write checks since I wasn't on the original lease and my boyfriend doesn't have a bank account) that I didn't mail it until the second. I mailed it from the post office immediately after I purchased the money order. The landlady came by on the 10th pissed because she didn't have rent yet. Now, this has happened before; once it was in the mailbox when she got home and another time her husband deposited it in his account not hers, and another time he just forgot to tell her, so I figured it was something similar, or mail was just running slow since it's the beginning of December.\n",
       "\n",
       "I showed her my money order stub, but she was adamant that I pay her. I went to the post office and paid to track the money order, which a refund could take a minimum of 60 days. I told her I was doing all of this and she agreed to it. She messaged me this morning saying that she still hasn't gotten the rent, and that I needed to make arrangements to pay her. I told her I was waiting on the post office, like she agreed to. I got online and tracked my request, and it said that \"refund eligibility was being processed.\" I told her this, and she said regardless I was responsible for it, and I responded that I was waiting on the post office, and that if I had to pay dpuble and the end of this month I would.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's the thing: they've made no secret about the fact that they want us out; we're grandfathered in at a way cheaper rate than anyone else in the building, and they tell us this all the time. When we had a volatile neighbor who was on pills, calling the police on everyone and having them and CPS called on her, fights outside at all hours, screaming of the adults and children at all hours, pets they're not supposed to have that the landlords know about, nothing was done. The landlords would just complain that they wished the people would move, or suggest that we move, but would never do anything. These people finally moved away, and the landlords have just finished fixing the apartment. \n",
       "\n",
       "I believe that they have the rent and are acting like they don't, hoping I don't have the money to pay double rent and can kick us out. I have the money to pay December now, and January at the end of this month, but it will be tight. Should I just pay and wait for my refund? If the post office shows that my original money order was cashed, am I out that money? \n",

       "The new query presents a multifaceted legal issue involving poor maintenance, unresponsive landlords, potential unauthorized entry and theft by the landlord, and a rent payment dispute possibly being leveraged for eviction purposes. The tenant's situation in Missouri shares several parallels with past cases, providing an informative basis for comparison. \n",
       "\n",
       "The scenario with the tenant experiencing multiple ongoing issues, including unaddressed maintenance problems and unauthorized entry, closely mirrors the situation described in [Search Result 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ea6gvy/who_do_i_contact_if_i_think_my_landlord_is_being/). Both highlight the challenges faced by tenants dealing with landlords who are slow or refuse to make necessary repairs, coupled with the suspicion that the landlord is entering their premises without permission. The advice sought in both queries centers on how to handle these complex tenant-landlord relationship issues, especially regarding the landlord's responsibilities for upkeep and respect for tenant privacy. \n",
       "\n",
       "The challenge of dealing with a rent payment dispute, where the tenant has made a good faith effort to pay rent on time but faces difficulties due to mail delivery issues, aligns with the primary concern of [Search Result 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ea6gvy/who_do_i_contact_if_i_think_my_landlord_is_being/) and is further compounded by the landlord's threats and the inherent fear of eviction. This situation also resonates with concerns raised in [Search Result 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/56uax5/missouri_landlord_attempting_to_evict/), where a Missouri resident faces eviction without proper notice and questionable rent increase demands. Both scenarios emphasize the precarious nature of tenant-landlord trust and the legal technicalities surrounding proper eviction processes and rent increase notices. \n",
       "\n",
       "Notably, the current query uniquely combines these elements into a single narrative, presenting a multifaceted legal dilemma. The past cases offer valuable insights into addressing each aspect individually but also illustrate the complexity of navigating these issues concurrently. Legal advice and intervention might be necessary to ensure that the tenant's rights are protected, especially when facing potential eviction under dubious circumstances. The incorporation of concerns regarding unauthorized entry, property theft, and exploitation of rent payment issues adds layers to the tenant's predicament, underscoring the importance of seeking comprehensive legal advice tailored to the specificities of the situation."

Well, I noticed on May 1 that I hadn’t been charged for rent, even though that transaction normally appears on my bank account on the day of, so I went to the resident portal to see what had happened. I saw that my apartment had been put “on notice,” and so my recurring payments had been cancelled. Okay, it’s not great that they didn’t tell me when I submitted my intent to vacate form that my recurring payments would be cancelled. However, at least I found out now, so this is no problem, I just submit my payment and hope that it’ll go through without having to pay any late fees.\n",
