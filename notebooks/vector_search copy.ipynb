       "However, as discussed in detail below, such a showing, by itself, is not sufficient to prove an “occurrence” because, under the express language of the policy, plaintiffs have to further show that the “exposure to conditions” was unexpected and unintended. Because of our holding in Emerson I that under Missouri law, the standard-form “sudden and accidental” exception to the pollution exclusion precludes coverage for property damage caused by gradual, non-abrupt releases of pollutants, plaintiffs are precluded from coverage of gradual pollution at the third-party sites under the 1984-85 policy. The National Priorities List is the EPA’s list of the most serious sites of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The Hatfield, Pennsylvania, site was a subject of our prior opinion in Emerson I. We held that plaintiffs had proven the “exposure to conditions” component of the definition of “occurrence” at that site and were not required to identify a specific event or release which caused the exposure. Emerson I, 319 Ill. App. 3d at 253-54, 743 N.E.2d at 655-56. However, as previously noted, having cleared that hurdle, plaintiffs still had to prove that the exposure was unexpected and unintended. The EPA defines a surface impoundment as a topographic depression, excavation, or diked area, primarily formed from earthen materials (lined or unlined) and designed to hold accumulated liquid wastes, wastes containing free liquids, or sludges. The TWA court, likewise, did not decide that question, having found that, irrespective of whether the term “sudden” must be interpreted with a temporal connotation, the releases were not “accidental.” As noted above, plaintiffs limited their motion as to the Hatfield, Pennsylvania, site to the 1983-84 policy. For the purposes of this analysis, we need not draw a distinction between the standard “sudden and accidental” exception to the pollution exclusion and the customized “accidental” exception. The court emphasized that “ ‘[t]here is a vast difference between an intended act, and an intended result.’ ” White, 440 S.W.2d at 507, quoting Murray v. Landenberger, 5 Ohio App. 2d 294, 299, 215 N.E.2d 412, 415-16 (1966). “Although the court discussed the decision of the Eighth Circuit reversing in part the district court’s holding in General Dynamics, it did so solely in reference to whether the term “sudden” in the “sudden and accidental” exception to the pollution "

      "Summary: While neither of these Missouri Court of Appeals decisions specifically addresses the word\n",
      "“accidental” as used in an exception to a pollution exclusion, their interpretations of the term\n",
      "“caused by accident” are in line with the decision in General Dynamics I. In N.W. Electric, the\n",
      "plaintiff cooperative, a supplier of electric power, sought coverage for damages to private property\n",
      "which resulted when the plaintiff exceeded an easement granted to it for construction of a power\n",
      "line over the property. The court concluded that while the acts producing the damage might be termed\n",
      "intentional, the resulting harm was “caused by accident” within the meaning of the insurance policy,\n",
      "where there was no evidence that the plaintiff cooperative knew of the acts which caused the damage\n",
      "or directed them to be done, nor was there any evidence of an intent to injure. N.W. Electric, 451\n",
      "S.W.2d at 361-62. Similarly, the court in White held that the contamination of a well was “caused by\n",
      "accident,” where a slaughterhouse intentionally dumped blood and waste materials into a pond, and\n",
      "where seepage from the pond during an “indeterminable period” contaminated the well. White, 440\n",

      "acts causing the damage were intentional, and it made no difference in White whether they were done\n",
      "over a period of time. Similar to General Dynamics I, the focus in each case is on the resulting\n",
      "damage and whether it was intentional. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the words “sudden\n",
      "and” were deleted from the pollution exclusion in Republic’s 1983-84 policy and that the exclusion\n",
      "thus allowed coverage for releases which were “accidental.” In addition, the language of that\n",
      "exclusion, with the exception of the aforementioned deletion, is substantially identical to the\n",
      "pollution exclusion in General Dynamics I, and the circumstances here are essentially similar to the\n",
      "situation in General Dynamics I. As indicated, J. Douglas James, who held management positions at\n",
      "the Urick Foundry in Erie, Pennsylvania, from 1954 to 1979, testified by affidavit that the wastes\n",
      "generated by the foundry were removed mainly by the Sitter Trucking Company and that Urick expected\n",
      "and intended that Sitter would dispose of the wastes in such a way that there would be no harm to\n",
      "the environment. Similarly, James Salsgiver, who was employed at the Chance facility in York,\n",
      "Pennsylvania, from 1954 to 1990, testified by affidavit that wastes generated at the facility were\n",
      "removed by a contractor in 55-gallon drums and taken to the landfill site in York, and that Chance\n",
      "neither expected nor intended that the disposal of its wastes would cause damage to the environment.\n",
      "Those affidavits at minimum raise a triable issue as to whether the releases of pollutants at the\n",

      "1983-84 policy. Summary judgment is inappropriate where there are such genuine issues of material\n",

      "Equipment Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 986 S.W.2d 477, 481 (Mo. App. 1998). Notwithstanding the\n",
      "foregoing, Republic argues that under Missouri law it is the intentional or unintentional nature of\n",
      "the initial discharge or shipment of pollutants which is the proper focus, not “any subsequent\n",
      "migration” of pollutants. Thus, according to Republic it makes no difference whether it was the\n",
      "policyholder who actually discharged the wastes into the environment. Republic finds some support\n",
      "for its position in the federal district court opinion in Independent Petrochemical Corp. v. Aetna\n",
      "Casualty & Surety Co., 842 F. Supp. 575 (D.D.C. 1994) (hereinafter IPC). In IPC, the plaintiffs\n",

      "waste material as a dust suppressant at a number of sites in Missouri. In granting summary judgment\n",
      "for the defendant insurers, the court held that it made no difference that the insured was not the\n",

      "data.\"). But Rogers still needed to show how his experience or expertise led to his conclusions.\n",
      "Rogers attempted to base his conclusions on inferences from qualities of the \"plume\" of\n",
      "contamination. That is, he looked at the size and scope of the contamination and worked backward to\n",
      "surmise how it must have occurred. For instance, Rogers testified that at the LASI site, the\n",

      "one at that site. He concluded that the contamination must have therefore been sudden and\n",
      "accidental. But Rogers failed to explain why this data mattered or why his inferences were\n",
      "justified. When pressed specifically on the connection between the contaminant mass and the\n",
      "circumstances of the release, he simply stated that the data was \"an indication\" but acknowledged\n",
      "that it was \"not conclusive.\" He opined that the sump itself had a \"sudden and accidental nature.\"\n",
      "But it's not clear what he meant, considering that the sump is just a basin in the ground. Rogers\n",
      "did say in passing that the contamination concentrations were \"not uniform,\" but he didn't explain\n",
      "why that was significant. Rogers's testimony about the Silvis site was equally lacking. He said that\n",

      "opined instead that it may have resulted from overfills of diesel locomotives. As to the chlorinated\n",
      "solvent storing area, Rogers suggested that perhaps a drum got punctured and caused the\n",
      "contamination. But Rogers offered no methodology to explain how he drew those conclusions. In short,\n",
      "Rogers failed to demonstrate that his conclusions were anything more than guesses. To satisfy\n",
      "Daubert , Rogers needed to provide an explanation of how the evidence led to his conclusions. He had\n",

      "beyond a simple say-so. If Rogers made an argument based on a reliable methodology, then Varlen has\n",

       "\n",
       "The examination of the phrase 'sudden and accidental' in the context of pollution exclusion clauses involves understanding how various courts have interpreted these terms within comprehensive general liability insurance policies. Here's a breakdown of several relevant cases:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Emerson I** highlighted cases both before and after a 1986 Missouri Supreme Court decision restricted the concept of 'sudden' to its traditional meaning (immediate and unexpected) but allowed for broader interpretations of 'accidental' (unintended and unforeseen events). The cases are highly relevant as they show the phrase's evolution in judicial interpretation. See [[1](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **N.W. Electric and White cases** delve into interpretations of \"accidental.\" They define an event as 'caused by accident' even if initial acts are intentional but result in unintended damage, reiterating that 'accidental' means lacks intent to harm. This nuanced view aligns with broader interpretations, arguing against a strictly temporal understanding of 'sudden.' See [[2](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/1527705/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Emerson I's consideration of policy language** regarding 'sudden and accidental' showcases judicial efforts to seek a balance between insurer liability and policyholder protection. The case reflects deliberation on how gradual processes yet resulting from 'accidental' circumstances doesn't meet the sudden and accidental criteria, emphasizing the temporal element of 'sudden.' See [[1](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **General Dynamics and IPC interpretations** contrast different jurisdictions considering 'accident'. The cases show distinct court tendencies, with some stressing intent while others look at whether the polluter exercised control, making them a useful comparative analysis tool. Specifically, these decisions underline differing judicial perspectives within various states regarding the interpretation of the clause. See [[2](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/1527705/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Case Law in Illinois** emphasizes how 'sudden and accidental' are tied together as well as individually dissected to determine applicability in pollution exclusions. The state-law-based interpretations provided are helpful in understanding regional judicial attitudes towards insurance policy enforcement. See [[1](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "These cases collectively provide a broader understanding of how different jurisdictions interpret the 'sudden and accidental' clause in pollution exclusions, highlighting shifts in legal interpretation over time, as well as variations across different states."

       "In addressing how courts have considered intentional versus unintentional polluting events in relation to the pollution exclusion clause in comprehensive general liability insurance policies, various legal cases provide extensive insights.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Cases and Considerations:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Intentional versus Unintentional Discharges**:\n",
       "   In many cases, the courts have closely examined whether the discharges were expected or intended by the insured to determine the applicability of the pollution exclusion. For instance, in case [1](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/12535237/), the court agreed with previous decisions that the pollution exclusion did not apply when the insured did not expect or intend for pollutants to enter the environment, implying that unintentional discharges can be covered under CGL policies despite pollution exclusions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Definition of 'Sudden and Accidental'**:\n",
       "   From cases such as [2](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/) and [10](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/), it is evident that the interpretation of 'sudden and accidental' within the pollution exclusion has been debated. For instance, case [10](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/5454708/) discusses how under Missouri law, 'sudden' has been interpreted more with respect to temporal elements and 'accidental' focuses on the unexpected nature of the release, thereby influencing coverage decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Distinguishing Factors between Legal Jurisdictions**:\n",
       "   Different jurisdictions have varied interpretations about what constitutes incidental pollution events as opposed to expected or intentional ones. This can be seen in [3](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/1527705/) where Missouri’s interpretations are referenced, which may contrast with those of other states showing the complexity and varied nature of legal interpretations across jurisdictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "These cases collectively depict how intentionality plays a crucial role in determining the applicability and reach of pollution exclusions. They also highlight the significance of the specific definitions used within policies and the specific language of the courts' interpretation of 'sudden and accidental'. This is instrumental in resolving the complexities surrounding the application of pollution exclusions in liability insurance policies."

National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania v. Glenview Park District, 158 Ill. 2d 116, 124, 632 N.E.2d 1039, 1042-43 (1994). However, even if an insurer has a duty to defend, whether the insurer will have a duty to indemnify the insured will only be ripe for determination after the insured has incurred liability in the underlying claim against it. Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 127, 607 N.E.2d at 1221. C. Relevant Policy Provisions and Their Meanings According to the general-coverage provision of the CGL policy at issue in this case: “This insurance applies to ‘bodily injury’ and ‘property damage’ only if: (1) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ is caused by an ‘occurrence’ that takes place in the ‘coverage territory’; and (2) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ occurs during the policy period.” The CGL policy at issue in this case assigns definitions to certain terms used in the policy. According to these definitions, the policy defines “property damage” as: “a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the ‘occurrence’ that caused it.” The policy defines an “occurrence” as “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” However, the CGL policy at issue does not define “accident.” The term has been interpreted in different ways as evidenced by our discussion below. Therefore, the term “accident” in the policy in question is ambiguous. Eljer Manufacturing, 197 Ill. 2d at 293, 757 N.E.2d at 491. As a result, for purposes of determining whether the damage to Rollings and Bowyer’s residence is the result of an accident, we must give the term a liberal construction in favor of coverage. Burgos, 145 Ill. 2d at 438, 583 N.E.2d at 554. One popular dictionary defines an “accident” as follows: “la: an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance b: lack of intention or necessity: CHANCE *** 2a: an unfortunate event resulting esp. from carelessness or ignorance b: an unexpected and medically important bodily event esp. when injurious **•* c: an unexpected happening causing loss or injury which is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured but for which legal relief may be sought *** 3: a nonessential property or quality of an entity or circumstance ***.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 7 (11th ed. 2003). Courts have defined an accident as “an unforeseen occurrence, usually of an untoward or disastrous character or an undesigned sudden or unexpected event of an inflictive or unfortunate character.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Freyer, 89 Ill. App. 3d 617, 619, 411 N.E.2d 1157, 1159 (1980). Some courts have also stated that the “natural and ordinary consequences of an act do not constitute an accident.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 89 Ill. App. 3d at 619, 411 N.E.2d at 1159; see also State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tillerson, 334 Ill. App. 3d 404, 409, 777 N.E.2d 986, 990 (2002); Monticello Insurance Co. v. Wil-Freds Construction, Inc., 277 Ill. App. 3d 697, 703, 661 N.E.2d 451, 455 (1996). The Supreme Court of Illinois has stated a court should not determine whether something is an accident by looking at whether the actions leading to the damage were intentionally done. According to the court, the real question is whether the person performing the acts leading to the result intended or expected the result. If the person did not intend or expect the result, then the result was the product of an accident. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Wilkin Insulation Co., 144 Ill. 2d 64, 77-78, 578 N.E.2d 926, 932 (1991); see also Yates v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 415 Ill. 16, 19, 111 N.E.2d 516, 517-18 (1953); Lyons v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 349 Ill. App. 3d 404, 409, 811 N.E.2d 718, 723 (2004). We apply this definition to the CGL policy at issue in this case. D. Property Damage To determine if the CGL policy applies to a claim in which a third party is seeking damages against the insured, the trial court must first determine if the third party has suffered “bodily injury” or “property damage” as defined by the policy. At issue in this case is whether Rollings and Bowyer suffered “property damage.” Rollings and Bowyer allege in the underlying complaint in case No. 04—L—08 that the negligent actions of defendant, his employees, agents, and/or subcontractors resulted in damage to their basement walls and other parts of the residence. They do not allege they only suffered intangible property losses, such as an economic loss, which courts do not usually consider “property damage.” Viking Construction Management, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 358 Ill. App. 3d 34, 42, 831 N.E.2d 1, 6-7 (2005). They allege physical injury to tangible property, their basement walls. This falls within the broad definition of “property damage” given by the policy. E. Occurrence If property damage occurred, the trial court must then determine if that property damage resulted from an “occurrence” as defined by the policy. In the underlying complaint in case No. 04—L—8, the two negligence counts against Carr simply allege that either Carr himself, his agents or employees, or his subcontractor used inappropriate backfill around the basement walls and then negligently operated heavy earthmoving equipment immediately adjacent to the basement walls. The counts allege these activities resulted in the sudden movement of the basement walls. The counts further allege the movement of the walls resulted in damage to those same walls and other parts of the residence.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n----------------------------------------\\nContent:\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key} = {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7398978401284662),\n",

The circuit court granted Connecticut’s motion for summary judgment, finding that while the underlying plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that they suffered “bodily injury” as defined in the policy, there was no coverage under the policy’s “total pollution exclusion.” The court also found that the underlying plaintiffs failed to allege “personal injury” and that, even if they did, the “absolute pollution exclusion” barred coverage. Loop Paper Recycling filed a timely notice of appeal. ANALYSIS Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits on file reveal that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Chatham Corp. v. Dann Insurance, 351 Ill. App. 3d 353, 358, 812 N.E.2d 483, 488 (2004). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we must construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Acceptance Insurance Co., 342 Ill.

The duty of an insurer to defend its insured is much broader than its duty to indemnify. Sears, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 171.

American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473, 479, 687 N.E.2d 72 (1997). In determining whether an insurer owes a duty to defend an action brought against its insured, the court must consider only the allegations in the underlying complaint and the relevant policy provisions. Lexmark International, Inc. v. Transportation Insurance Co., 327 Ill. App. 3d 128, 136, 761 N.E.2d 1214 (2001), quoting Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Fulkerson, 212 Ill.

Progressive Universal Insurance Co. of Illinois v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 347 Ill. App. 3d 411, 414, 806 N.E.2d 1224 (2004).

Home Insurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 940, 950-51, 795 N.E.2d 412 (2003). A court must construe the policy as a whole and take into account the type of insurance purchased, the nature of the risks involved, and the overall purpose of the contract. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 479. If the words of a policy are clear and unambiguous, they must be afforded their plain, ordinary and popular meaning.

The policy in this case begins by stating that Connecticut will provide coverage for “those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance applies.” “Bodily injury” is defined in the policy as an “injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.” Under the policy’s “total pollution exclusion,” however, no coverage exists if the “bodily injury *** would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants at any time.” The “total pollution exclusion” contains an exception, which reinstates coverage if the “bodily injury” arises “out of heat, smoke or fumes from a hostile fire.”', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n----------------------------------------\\nContent:\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key} = {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7363709543699168),\n",

The circuit court granted Connecticut’s motion for summary judgment, finding that while the underlying plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that they suffered “bodily injury” as defined in the policy, there was no coverage under the policy’s “total pollution exclusion.” The court also found that the underlying plaintiffs failed to allege “personal injury” and that, even if they did, the “absolute pollution exclusion” barred coverage. Loop Paper Recycling filed a timely notice of appeal. ANALYSIS Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits on file reveal that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Chatham Corp. v. Dann Insurance, 351 Ill. App. 3d 353, 358, 812 N.E.2d 483, 488 (2004). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we must construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Acceptance Insurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 167, 171, 793 N.E.2d 736 (2003). We review a trial court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Sears, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 171. The duty of an insurer to defend its insured is much broader than its duty to indemnify. Sears, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 171. When determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured, the court must compare the allegations contained in the underlying complaint to the relevant provisions of the insurance policy. American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473, 479, 687 N.E.2d 72 (1997). In determining whether an insurer owes a duty to defend an action brought against its insured, the court must consider only the allegations in the underlying complaint and the relevant policy provisions. Lexmark International, Inc. v. Transportation Insurance Co., 327 Ill. App. 3d 128, 136, 761 N.E.2d 1214 (2001), quoting Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Fulkerson, 212 Ill. App. 3d 556, 562, 571 N.E.2d 256 (1991). “[Wjhere summary judgment is sought in the context of a declaratory judgment action to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend, the use of extrinsic evidence is inappropriate.” Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 315 Ill. App. 3d 552, 567, 734 N.E.2d 50 (2000). If the court determines that the allegations fall within, or potentially within, coverage under the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured against the underlying complaint. Progressive Universal Insurance Co. of Illinois v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 347 Ill. App. 3d 411, 414, 806 N.E.2d 1224 (2004). Insurance policies are to be liberally construed in favor of coverage, and where an ambiguity exists in the terms of the contract, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer. Traveler’s Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 278, 293, 757 N.E.2d 481 (2001). The insurer bears the burden of establishing that a claim falls within a provision that limits or excludes coverage. Progressive Universal, 347 Ill. App. 3d at 414. When construing an insurance policy, the primary function of the court is to ascertain and enforce the intentions of the parties as expressed in the agreement. Central Illinois Light Co. v. Home Insurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 940, 950-51, 795 N.E.2d 412 (2003). A court must construe the policy as a whole and take into account the type of insurance purchased, the nature of the risks involved, and the overall purpose of the contract. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 479. If the words of a policy are clear and unambiguous, they must be afforded their plain, ordinary and popular meaning. Traveler’s Insurance Co., 197 Ill. 2d at 292, quoting Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 108, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1993). Unambiguous clauses within insurance contracts must be enforced according to their terms and courts should refrain from adopting interpretations resulting in distortions and creating ambiguities where none exist.

United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 144 Ill. 2d at 73.

United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 144 Ill. 2d at 74 . In accordance with the above propositions of law, we must analyze the underlying complaint in light of the applicable policy provisions to determine whether the claim is within or potentially within coverage. Both Atlantic Mutual and Centennial rely on portions of their CGL policies that provide coverage only for bodily injury caused by an “occurrence” as defined in their respective policies. Centennial’s CGL policy provides the following: “This company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of A. personal injury or B. property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and the Company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such personal injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient ***.” The Centennial CGL policy defines “occurrence” as follows: “[A]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in personal injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.” (Emphasis added.) The Centennial CGL policy definition of “personal injury” includes “bodily injury.” The Atlantic Mutual CGL policy provides the following: “[W]e will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance applies. >!< si< This insurance applies only to ‘bodily injury’ and ‘property damage’ which occurs during the policy period. The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ must be caused by an ‘occurrence.’ ” Under the Atlantic Mutual CGL policy “occurrence” is defined as: “[A]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” The Atlantic Mutual CGL policy defines “bodily injury” as follows: “ ‘Bodily injury’ means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.” The definition of “bodily injury” provides an exclusion for “ ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.” (Emphasis added.) We note that neither the Atlantic Mutual policy nor the Centennial policy defines “accident.” We therefore look to Illinois case law for guidance as to the interpretation of this term. Illinois courts have defined “accident” as follows: “[A]n unforeseen occurrence, usually of an untoward or disastrous character or an undesigned sudden or unexpected event of an inflictive or unfortunate character.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Freyer, 89 Ill. App. 3d 617, 619, 411 N.E.2d 1157 (1980). Citing this language, in State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Watters, 268 Ill. App. 3d 501, 644 N.E.2d 492 (1994), appeal denied, 161 Ill. 2d 540, 649 N.E.2d 425 (1994), this court held that “an occurrence which is defined as an accident involves the consideration of whether the injury was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.” State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 268 Ill. App. 3d at 506. Under Illinois law addressing the definition of “occurrence,” the issue that must be determined is whether the injury was expected or intended, not whether the acts were performed intentionally. Bay State Insurance Co. v. Wilson, 96 Ill. 2d 487, 493-94, 451 N.E.2d 880 (1983). The terms “expected” and “intended” cannot be treated as synonymous since, if they were, there would be no reason to include both of them in the clause. Bay State Insurance Co., 96 Ill. 2d at 494. A greater degree of proof is required to establish intent than to establish expectation. Bay State, 96 Ill. 2d at 494. If the actor expects or intends the injury to follow from the act, there is no coverage under the policy. However, even an intentional act will be covered under the policy language at issue if it causes an unexpected or unintended result. See Country Mutual Insurance Co., 298 Ill. App. 3d at 508. Defendants specifically assert that the trial court erred in finding that defendants intended or expected the pedicle screws to harm the underlying plaintiffs. Defendants argue that the underlying complaint does not allege that they conspired or acted in concert to injure patients receiving pedicle screws. Plaintiffs respond that defendants did intend that pedicle screws be implanted in patients in violation of FDA regulations and that by the very nature of a civil conspiracy and/or concerted action claim, defendants’ actions were intentional and therefore coverage is precluded. Plaintiffs urge this court to adopt the reasoning of the California Court of Appeals as enunciated in Fibreboard Corp. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 16 Cal. App. 4th 492, 510-11, 20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 376, 387 (1993). In that case, numerous plaintiffs sued Fibreboard, a manufacturer of asbestos products, under a theory of civil conspiracy. The manufacturer then brought a declaratory judgment action against several insurers seeking coverage for the claims. The California Court of Appeals held: “[T]here is a conscious, decisionmaking element that takes civil conspiracies out of the range of behavior encompassed within the meaning of an ‘occurrence.’ An insured who participates in a conspiracy, even if the agreed upon behavior or course of conduct is to act negligently, cannot expect coverage for ‘an accident.’ In its plain, ordinary sense, an accident is ‘an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance.’ (Webster’s New Collegiate Diet. (9th ed. 1984) p.49.) As a matter of law, a civil conspiracy cannot occur by accident; therefore, the policies afford no coverage for these claims. [Citations.]” Fibreboard, 16 Cal.

According to these definitions, the policy defines “property damage” as: “a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the ‘occurrence’ that caused it.” The policy defines an “occurrence” as “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” However, the CGL policy at issue does not define “accident.” The term has been interpreted in different ways as evidenced by our discussion below. Therefore, the term “accident” in the policy in question is ambiguous. Eljer Manufacturing, 197 Ill. 2d at 293, 757 N.E.2d at 491. As a result, for purposes of determining whether the damage to Rollings and Bowyer’s residence is the result of an accident, we must give the term a liberal construction in favor of coverage. Burgos, 145 Ill. 2d at 438, 583 N.E.2d at 554. One popular dictionary defines an “accident” as follows: “la: an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance b: lack of intention or necessity: CHANCE *** 2a: an unfortunate event resulting esp. from carelessness or ignorance b: an unexpected and medically important bodily event esp. when injurious **•* c: an unexpected happening causing loss or injury which is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured but for which legal relief may be sought *** 3: a nonessential property or quality of an entity or circumstance ***.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 7 (11th ed. 2003). Courts have defined an accident as “an unforeseen occurrence, usually of an untoward or disastrous character or an undesigned sudden or unexpected event of an inflictive or unfortunate character.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Freyer, 89 Ill. App. 3d 617, 619, 411 N.E.2d 1157, 1159 (1980). Some courts have also stated that the “natural and ordinary consequences of an act do not constitute an accident.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 89 Ill. App. 3d at 619, 411 N.E.2d at 1159; see also State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tillerson, 334 Ill. App. 3d 404, 409, 777 N.E.2d 986, 990 (2002); Monticello Insurance Co. v. Wil-Freds Construction, Inc., 277 Ill. App. 3d 697, 703, 661 N.E.2d 451, 455 (1996). The Supreme Court of Illinois has stated a court should not determine whether something is an accident by looking at whether the actions leading to the damage were intentionally done. According to the court, the real question is whether the person performing the acts leading to the result intended or expected the result. If the person did not intend or expect the result, then the result was the product of an accident. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Wilkin Insulation Co., 144 Ill. 2d 64, 77-78, 578 N.E.2d 926, 932 (1991); see also Yates v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 415 Ill. 16, 19, 111 N.E.2d 516, 517-18 (1953); Lyons v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 349 Ill. App. 3d 404, 409, 811 N.E.2d 718, 723 (2004). We apply this definition to the CGL policy at issue in this case. D. Property Damage To determine if the CGL policy applies to a claim in which a third party is seeking damages against the insured, the trial court must first determine if the third party has suffered “bodily injury” or “property damage” as defined by the policy. At issue in this case is whether Rollings and Bowyer suffered “property damage.” Rollings and Bowyer allege in the underlying complaint in case No. 04—L—08 that the negligent actions of defendant, his employees, agents, and/or subcontractors resulted in damage to their basement walls and other parts of the residence. They do not allege they only suffered intangible property losses, such as an economic loss, which courts do not usually consider “property damage.” Viking Construction Management, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 358 Ill. App. 3d 34, 42, 831 N.E.2d 1, 6-7 (2005). They allege physical injury to tangible property, their basement walls. This falls within the broad definition of “property damage” given by the policy. E. Occurrence If property damage occurred, the trial court must then determine if that property damage resulted from an “occurrence” as defined by the policy. In the underlying complaint in case No. 04—L—8, the two negligence counts against Carr simply allege that either Carr himself, his agents or employees, or his subcontractor used inappropriate backfill around the basement walls and then negligently operated heavy earthmoving equipment immediately adjacent to the basement walls. The counts allege these activities resulted in the sudden movement of the basement walls. The counts further allege the movement of the walls resulted in damage to those same walls and other parts of the residence. The underlying complaint does not contain allegations that defendant, his employees or agents, or subcontractors intended or expected, by their use of allegedly inappropriate backfill material or their allegedly negligent operation of heavy earthmoving equipment near the basement walls, that the walls would move or be damaged. Under our supreme court’s definition of what constitutes an “accident,” the allegations of the complaint in case No. 04—L—8 allege an “accident.” As a result, we find the allegations in the underlying complaint describe an “occurrence” as defined by the policy at issue. The allegations in counts I and II of the underlying complaint fall within the provisions of the general coverage provisions of the policy at issue. F.

Further, paragraph 36 stated, “the property damage [at issue] *** is allegedly continuous and progressive beginning before 1961 and continuing to 1986 or thereafter.” Because of the Insurers’ refusal to defend the BFG counterclaim, plaintiffs alleged that they incurred defense costs of $1,953,186. The record reveals that the BFG suit was resolved by settlement whereby plaintiffs were ordered to pay BFG $1 million. In an order entered October 10, 2000, the trial court granted the Insurers’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third amended complaint for declaratory judgment. The trial court concluded that the allegations in the BFG counterclaim arose out of an alleged breach of the asset purchase agreement and did not amount to an “occurrence” as defined in the policies. Therefore, the trial court found the allegations in the underlying complaint did not fall within or potentially within the policies’ coverage for environmental contamination or property damage. The trial court further found that the BFG counterclaim did not precisely allege when the damage, for which BFG sought reimbursement under the asset purchase agreement, occurred. Since the policies expired eight years before the asset purchase agreement was executed, the trial court concluded that it was impossible to determine on the face of the pleadings whether the policies would have been in effect when the alleged environmental damage occurred. In another order entered October 19, 2000, the trial court confirmed the dismissal order of October 10, 2000, and made a written finding under Supreme Court Rule 304(a). 155 Ill. 2d R. 304(a). Plaintiffs now appeal. We first address whether the trial court correctly granted the Insurers’ motion to dismiss on the ground that the allegations in the BFG counterclaim did not constitute an occurrence under the policies and, thus, did not fall within or potentially within the policies’ coverage. This court reviews a trial court’s ruling upon a motion to dismiss de novo. Royal Insurance Co. of America v. Insignia Financial Group, Inc., 323 Ill. App. 3d 58, 63, 751 N.E.2d 164 (2001); Stokes v. Pekin Insurance Co., 298 Ill. App. 3d 278, 280, 698 N.E.2d 252 (1998). It is well settled in Illinois: “To determine whether the insurer has a duty to defend the insured, the court must look to the allegations in the underlying complaint and compare these allegations to the relevant provisions of the insurance policy. [Citations.] If the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall within, or potentially within, the policy’s coverage, the insurer’s duty to defend arises. [Citations.] Refusal to defend is unjustifiable unless it is clear from the face of the underlying complaint that the facts alleged do not fall potentially within the policy’s coverage.” Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 107-08, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1992). Plaintiffs contend that the allegations in the counterclaim fall within the policies’ coverage. In support of their argument, they primarily rely upon paragraphs 79 through 85 of the counterclaim filed by BFG. These paragraphs alleged the following: “79. Environmental investigations performed on behalf of BFG confirm that a wide-range of ‘Hazardous Substances,’ as that term is defined by the [Asset Purchase] Agreement, have been identified at levels exceeding those allowable under human health and environmental protection standards in soils and groundwater at the facilities formerly operated by Pneumo Abex and transferred to BFG. 80. Environmental investigations conducted at the Cleveland New Main facility estáblish that the soils and groundwater in and around the facility are contaminated with volatile organic compounds, solvents, heavy metals, and total petroleum hydrocarbons at levels exceeding human health and environmental protection standards established under ‘Environmental Laws,’ as that term is defined in the Agreement. 81. The contamination at the Cleveland New Main facility, if left unremediated, threatens the quality of site groundwater, the safely of workers and others that may become involved in site operation, construction or maintenance activities, and soils and groundwater at neighboring properties, including residences. These conditions are attributable to events and activities that occurred prior to Plaintiffs current stewardship of the facility. 82. Environmental investigations conducted at the Cleveland Plating facility establish that the soils and groundwater at the facility are contaminated with chlorinate organic contaminants and petroleum at levels exceeding human health and environmental protection standards established under ‘Environmental Laws,’ as that term is defined in the Agreement. 83. The contamination at the Cleveland Plating facility, if left un-remediated, presents a substantial risk for off-site migration, and thus threatens the soils and groundwater at neighboring properties. These conditions are attributable to events and activities that occurred prior to BFG’s current stewardship of the facility. 84. Environmental investigations conducted at the Tullahoma facility establish that the soils and subsurface areas of the facility are contaminated with volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons at levels exceeding human health and environmental protection standards established under ‘Environmental Laws,’ as that term is defined in the Agreement. 85. The contamination at the Tullahoma facility, if left unremedi-ated, threatens the quality of groundwater and presents a substantial risk for migration to off-site properties. These conditions are attributable to events and activities that occurred prior to BFG’s current stewardship of the property.” In order to find a duty to defend, we would have to conclude that the above allegations, along with any other in the counterclaim, fall within or potentially within the subject policies’ coverage. As noted above, the instant policies provided that: “ ‘occurrence’ means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.” An accident has been interpreted to mean “ ‘an unforeseen occurrence *** of untoward or disastrous character’ or ‘an undesigned sudden or unexpected event.’ ” Bituminous Casualty Corp. v.

II. ANALYSIS Carr argues the third amended complaint in the underlying case (case No. 04—L—8) alleges an “occurrence” covered by his CGL policy through Country Mutual. A. Standard of Review The standard of review for reviewing a trial court’s decision to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings is de novo. Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois v. City of Chicago, 317 Ill. App. 3d 569, 571, 740 N.E.2d 515, 517 (2000). The same is true for reviewing a trial court’s interpretation of an insurance policy. Travelers Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 278, 292, 757 N.E.2d 481, 491 (2001). In this appeal, we must determine whether the trial court erred in finding the complaint in the underlying case did not allege an “occurrence.” B. Insurance Company’s Duty To Defend The underlying issues in case No. 04—L—15 from which this appeal arises are whether Country Mutual has a duty to defend and possibly indemnify Carr in case No. 04—L—8. An insurance company’s duty to defend its policyholder is much broader than its duty to indemnify that same policyholder. Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 125, 607 N.E.2d 1204, 1220 (1992). To determine whether an insurance company has a duty to defend, the court must compare the allegations in the underlying complaint to the language of the insurance policy at issue. Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 125, 607 N.E.2d at 1220. In so doing, the court must give the allegations in the complaint a liberal construction in favor of the insured. Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 125, 607 N.E.2d at 1220. Further, the court must liberally construe the provisions of the insurance policy in favor of coverage. State Security Insurance Co. v. Burgos, 145 Ill. 2d 423, 438, 583 N.E.2d 547, 554 (1991). After giving both the allegations in the complaint and the provisions of the policy a liberal construction in favor of the insured having coverage, the court must determine if the “allegations fall within, or potentially within, the policy’s coverage.” (Emphasis in original.) Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 125, 607 N.E.2d at 1220. If the court finds this to be so, “the insurer has a duty to defend the insured against the underlying complaint.” Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 125, 607 N.E.2d at 1220. Even if only one of several theories of recovery put forward by a plaintiff is within the potential coverage of the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured on all theories of recovery. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania v. Glenview Park District, 158 Ill. 2d 116, 124, 632 N.E.2d 1039, 1042-43 (1994). However, even if an insurer has a duty to defend, whether the insurer will have a duty to indemnify the insured will only be ripe for determination after the insured has incurred liability in the underlying claim against it. Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 127, 607 N.E.2d at 1221. C. Relevant Policy Provisions and Their Meanings According to the general-coverage provision of the CGL policy at issue in this case: “This insurance applies to ‘bodily injury’ and ‘property damage’ only if: (1) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ is caused by an ‘occurrence’ that takes place in the ‘coverage territory’; and (2) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ occurs during the policy period.” The CGL policy at issue in this case assigns definitions to certain terms used in the policy. According to these definitions, the policy defines “property damage” as: “a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the ‘occurrence’ that caused it.” The policy defines an “occurrence” as “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” However, the CGL policy at issue does not define “accident.” The term has been interpreted in different ways as evidenced by our discussion below. Therefore, the term “accident” in the policy in question is ambiguous. Eljer Manufacturing, 197 Ill. 2d at 293, 757 N.E.2d at 491. As a result, for purposes of determining whether the damage to Rollings and Bowyer’s residence is the result of an accident, we must give the term a liberal construction in favor of coverage. Burgos, 145 Ill. 2d at 438, 583 N.E.2d at 554. One popular dictionary defines an “accident” as follows: “la: an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance b: lack of intention or necessity: CHANCE *** 2a: an unfortunate event resulting esp. from carelessness or ignorance b: an unexpected and medically important bodily event esp. when injurious **•* c: an unexpected happening causing loss or injury which is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured but for which legal relief may be sought *** 3: a nonessential property or quality of an entity or circumstance ***.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 7 (11th ed. 2003). Courts have defined an accident as “an unforeseen occurrence, usually of an untoward or disastrous character or an undesigned sudden or unexpected event of an inflictive or unfortunate character.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Freyer, 89 Ill. App. 3d 617, 619, 411 N.E.2d 1157, 1159 (1980). Some courts have also stated that the “natural and ordinary consequences of an act do not constitute an accident.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 89 Ill.

However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any ‘suit’ seeking damages for ‘personal injury’ or ‘advertising injury’ to which this insurance does not apply.” Coverage B contained an “absolute pollution exclusion,” which stated: “[Absolute Pollution Exclusion to Coverage B] 2. Exclusions This insurance does not apply to: a. ‘Personal injury’ or ‘advertising injury;’ (5) Arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants at any time. ❖ * * Pollutants means any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.” On September 28, 2001, Connecticut filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, arguing that, under the terms of the policy, it owed no duty to defend or provide coverage to Loop Paper Recycling in the lawsuit filed by the underlying plaintiffs. The circuit court granted Connecticut’s motion for summary judgment, finding that while the underlying plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that they suffered “bodily injury” as defined in the policy, there was no coverage under the policy’s “total pollution exclusion.” The court also found that the underlying plaintiffs failed to allege “personal injury” and that, even if they did, the “absolute pollution exclusion” barred coverage. Loop Paper Recycling filed a timely notice of appeal. ANALYSIS Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits on file reveal that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Chatham Corp. v. Dann Insurance, 351 Ill. App. 3d 353, 358, 812 N.E.2d 483, 488 (2004). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we must construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Acceptance Insurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 167, 171, 793 N.E.2d 736 (2003). We review a trial court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Sears, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 171. The duty of an insurer to defend its insured is much broader than its duty to indemnify. Sears, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 171. When determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured, the court must compare the allegations contained in the underlying complaint to the relevant provisions of the insurance policy. American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473, 479, 687 N.E.2d 72 (1997). In determining whether an insurer owes a duty to defend an action brought against its insured, the court must consider only the allegations in the underlying complaint and the relevant policy provisions. Lexmark International, Inc. v. Transportation Insurance Co., 327 Ill. App. 3d 128, 136, 761 N.E.2d 1214 (2001), quoting Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Fulkerson, 212 Ill. App. 3d 556, 562, 571 N.E.2d 256 (1991). “[Wjhere summary judgment is sought in the context of a declaratory judgment action to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend, the use of extrinsic evidence is inappropriate.” Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 315 Ill. App. 3d 552, 567, 734 N.E.2d 50 (2000). If the court determines that the allegations fall within, or potentially within, coverage under the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured against the underlying complaint. Progressive Universal Insurance Co. of Illinois v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 347 Ill. App. 3d 411, 414, 806 N.E.2d 1224 (2004). Insurance policies are to be liberally construed in favor of coverage, and where an ambiguity exists in the terms of the contract, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer. Traveler’s Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 278, 293, 757 N.E.2d 481 (2001). The insurer bears the burden of establishing that a claim falls within a provision that limits or excludes coverage. Progressive Universal, 347 Ill. App. 3d at 414. When construing an insurance policy, the primary function of the court is to ascertain and enforce the intentions of the parties as expressed in the agreement. Central Illinois Light Co. v. Home Insurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 940, 950-51, 795 N.E.2d 412 (2003). A court must construe the policy as a whole and take into account the type of insurance purchased, the nature of the risks involved, and the overall purpose of the contract. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 479. If the words of a policy are clear and unambiguous, they must be afforded their plain, ordinary and popular meaning. Traveler’s Insurance Co., 197 Ill. 2d at 292, quoting Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 108, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1993). Unambiguous clauses within insurance contracts must be enforced according to their terms and courts should refrain from adopting interpretations resulting in distortions and creating ambiguities where none exist. Young v. Allstate Insurance Co., 351 Ill. App. 3d 151, 157-58, 812 N.E.2d 741 (2004). I. COVERAGE A: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY Though the policy here contains a maze of provisions that must be navigated in order to determine whether coverage for bodily injury resulting from a fire exists, in the end, the determination hinges upon the kind of business Loop Paper Recycling was running at its River-dale facility. The policy in this case begins by stating that Connecticut will provide coverage for “those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance applies.” “Bodily injury” is defined in the policy as an “injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.”', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n----------------------------------------\\nContent:\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key} = {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7223728580165872),\n",

The cleaning company appeals. On appeal, the cleaning company contends : (1) the circuit court erred in finding that the absolute pollution exclusions preclude coverage; and (2) the insurer breached its duty to defend and is estopped from raising the exclusions as defenses to coverage. We affirm. The cleaning company leases property at 1730 West Fullerton Avenue, where it operates a dry cleaning and laundry store. One of the cleaning company’s dry cleaning machines malfunctioned, releasing perc onto the floor and into the soil underneath the property. Later, the cleaning company was sued twice by the managing agent for the property’s owner, Centrum Properties, Inc. (Centrum). The first lawsuit alleged the cleaning company had breached its lease by permitting perc to be released; the second lawsuit sought^ injunctive relief and damages, including the cost of removing the perc. The cleaning company notified State Farm of the lawsuits and then settled the lawsuits, agreeing to take responsibility for 75% of the remediation costs. State Farm subsequently denied coverage for the settlement. The cleaning company then filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that State Farm breached its duty to defend and indemnify. The circuit court granted judgment on the pleadings for State Farm, finding there was no coverage under the policy’s pollution exclusions. The cleaning company appeals. Our review of the circuit court’s order granting State Farm’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is de novo. Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. Steinitz, 288 Ill. App. 3d 926, 934 (1997). A motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a motion for summary judgment limited to the pleadings. Employers Insurance v. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d 127, 138 (1999). On review, we examine the pleadings to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and, if not, whether the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Ehlco, 186 Ill. 2d at 138; Steinitz, 288 Ill. App. 3d at 934. In determining whether judgment on the pleadings for State Farm is proper, we construe the insurance policy at issue. Our construction of the insurance policy is also de novo. American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473, 479-80 (1997). First, the cleaning company argues for coverage under the policy’s “Business Liability” section. Second, the cleaning company argues for coverage under the policy’s “Property Damage Legal Liability” section. Third, the cleaning company argues that State Farm breached its duty to defend and is estopped from raising policy defenses. I. The Business Liability Section The Business Liability section states in relevant part: “We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of *** property damage ***.” The cleaning company contends that the discharge of the perc into the land beneath its dry cleaning and laundry store constituted covered “property damage.” However, the Business Liability coverage grant is subject to the so-called “absolute pollution exclusion.” The absolute pollution exclusion states that the insurance does not apply to any: “a. property damage *** arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, seepage, migration, dispersal, spill, release or escape of pollutants: . * * b. loss, cost or expense arising out of any: (1) request, demand or order that any insured or others test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize or in any way respond to or assess the effects of pollutants.” The policy defines “pollutants” as: “[A]ny solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.” (Emphasis added.) Perc is a chemical and, as such, it falls within the absolute pollution exclusion’s definition of a pollutant excluded from coverage. However, the cleaning company argues that a recent Illinois Supreme Court case, American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473 (1997), compels a different result. In Koloms, the insured sought coverage for injuries caused by carbon monoxide fumes emitted from a building’s faulty furnace. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 476. The insurer argued that the carbon monoxide fumes were a pollutant and, thus, excluded from coverage under the absolute pollution exclusion in the policy. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 476-77. The absolute pollution exclusion in Koloms, like the exclusion at issue here, stated it eliminated coverage for property damage arising out of “ ‘actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of *** any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.’ ” Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 487. The supreme court noted several recent opinions criticizing the absolute pollution exclusions’s broad definition of a pollutant as an “irritant” or “contaminant.”', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n----------------------------------------\\nContent:\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key} = {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7185837587679739)]"

The National Priorities List is the EPA’s list of the most serious sites of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States.

Pollution Exclusions ¶ 57 We are also asked to consider whether the pollution exclusions in the policies apply. Travelers contends coverage is barred by the pollution exclusions contained in some of the policies because Rogers's liabilities are the result of decades of intentional discharges of hazardous chemicals into the soil, unlined ponds, and a public sewer. Rogers responds that (1) Travelers should be estopped from raising any exclusions, (2) its use of containment ponds and Sauget's sewer system does not implicate Travelers' pollution exclusion, (3) it did not expect or intend overflows from the sewer system or retention ponds, and (4) its use of sewers and ponds was not illegal. ¶ 58 As set forth in our consideration of the first issue, Travelers is estopped from raisin</td>\n",

The court concluded that while the acts producing the damage might be termed intentional, the resulting harm was “caused by accident” within the meaning of the insurance policy, where there was no evidence that the plaintiff cooperative knew of the acts which caused the damage or directed them to be done, nor was there any evidence of an intent to injure.

Travelers contends coverage is barred by the pollution exclusions contained in some of the policies because Rogers's liabilities are the result of decades of intentional discharges of hazardous chemicals into the soil, unlined ponds, and a public sewer. Rogers responds that (1) Travelers should be estopped from raising any exclusions, (2) its use of containment ponds and Sauget's sewer system does not implicate Travelers' pollution exclusion, (3) it did not expect or intend overflows from the sewer system or retention ponds, and (4) its use of sewers and ponds was not illegal. ¶ 58 As set forth in our consideration of the first issue, Travelers is estopped from raisin</td>\n",

The court concluded that while the acts producing the damage might be termed intentional, the resulting harm was “caused by accident” within the meaning of the insurance policy, where there was no evidence that the plaintiff cooperative knew of the acts which caused the damage or directed them to be done, nor was there any evidence of an intent to injure.

This principle can be crucial in analyzing how 'sudden and accidental' is defined, especially if the policy language does not explicitly clarify whether gradual pollution events are covered.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Determination of Coverage in Complex Scenarios**: The case discusses how insurers determine coverage in intricate situations, including pollution or property damage. This is particularly relevant for evaluating how the 'sudden and accidental' phrase is applied in claims involving gradual but unintentional polluting events, which are complex by nature.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Pollution Exclusions**: The case outlines the conditions under which pollution exclusions apply. This directly touches upon how 'sudden and accidental' might be interpreted in the context of pollution exclusions, providing a foundation for understanding whether and how such clauses might exclude or include coverage for gradual pollution incidents.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the principles established in 578 N.E.2d 926 suggest that in cases involving ambiguous policy terms or complex scenarios like gradual pollution, the interpretation is likely to lean in favor of the insured. Therefore, if the phrase 'sudden and accidental' within the pollution exclusion clause is ambiguous or can be interpreted in more than one way in the context of gradual but unintentional polluting events, the precedent suggests that courts might favor an interpretation that includes coverage for such events under CGL insurance policies. This precedent can be remendously valuable for legal researchers or practitioners arguing for the inclusion of gradual pollution incidents in insurance coverage, despite the presence of a pollution exclusion clause."

       "- **United States Gypsum Co. v. Admiral Insurance Co., [1] & [3]:** These entries note the application of the 'continuous trigger approach' for progressive and inseparable property damage and the interpretation of insurance coverage through cause analysis. While not directly referencing 'sudden and accidental,' these cases are significant for understanding how courts may approach policy interpretations involving gradual pollution events. The principles of cause analysis and continuous trigger might be indirectly relevant to dissecting the 'sudden and accidental' clause in pollution exclusions.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Travelers Insurance Co. v. Eljer Manufacturing, Inc., [6] & [17]:** These references address the construction of insurance policy provisions and interpretation duties of insurers. They establish guidelines that might be applicable when debating the definition and application of 'sudden and accidental' in pollution exclusions, especially since the summary points to discussions around 'occurrence' and 'property damage' in insurance contracts.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Zurich Insurance Co. v. Raymark Industries, Inc., [18]:** This case directly deals with the interpretation of policy terms, especially concerning duties to defend and indemnify and trigger of coverage for specific claims like asbestos exposure. While not exclusively concerning pollution, the principles set forth regarding insurance policy interpretation could be instrumental in understanding how 'sudden and accidental' might be construed in the context of pollution.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Discussion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The analyzed cases suggest that the interpretation of 'sudden and accidental' within pollution exclusions likely depends on broader legal principles of insurance policy interpretation, including the continuous trigger for coverage and cause analysis. Since gradual pollution events fall outside the traditional 'sudden' framework, the application of these clauses would require a nuanced approach, examining the specific language of the policy and considering precedents that interpret similar terms.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the indirect relevance of the discussed cases, further research into directly related case law or advisory opinions concerning 'sudden and accidental' in the context of CGL policies and pollution exclusions might be necessary. However, these cases provide a foundational understanding of how courts approach complex policy interpretations and might influence arguments concerning the applicability of pollution exclusions to gradual environmental damage."
