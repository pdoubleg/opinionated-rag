       "Cunningham Enterprises, Inc. (Cunningham), sued its liability insurer, Universal Underwriters (Universal), alleging Universal breached its duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by a third party. After Cunningham and Universal each moved for summary judgment, the court denied Universal’s motion, granted Cunningham’s motion, and entered judgment in Cunningham’s favor for $197,837.59 plus costs. Universal appeals.\n",
       "\n",
       "We conclude the undisputed facts establish the absence of a potential for coverage under the relevant insurance policies and therefore Universal had no duty to defend Cunningham in the underlying action. Thus, the trial court erred in granting Cunningham summary judgment and in denying Universal’s summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for the court to enter summary judgment in Universal’s favor.\n",

       "This case concerns whether Universal had a duty to defend Cunningham in an action brought by Steven Beus and his limited liability company (collectively Beus). Beus’s complaint alleged the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "In April 1996, Beus met with a real estate agent representing Cunningham regarding potential sites for an Isuzu dealership. The agent showed Beus property owned by Cunningham located on Johnson Avenue in El Cajon (the Johnson property). The Johnson property consisted of a front lot and a rear lot. “The rear lot was ‘improved’ with dilapidated and unsightly . . . buildings.” The front lot was improved with structures appropriate for use as an automobile dealership. Cunningham’s real estate agent told Beus that the tenant on the front lot, Holland Motor Homes, would vacate the premises in late November or early December.\n",
       "\n",
       "In September 1996, Beus and Cunningham entered into a. written lease agreement pertaining to the Johnson property. Although the agreement specifically provided that the January 1, 1997 lease commencement date was “subject to . . . Holland . . . vacating the Premises,” Beus alleged that “the true intent of the parties was that the lease commencement date could be made earlier, but not later, than January 1, 1997.”\n",
       "\n",
       "In reliance on representations that Holland would be vacating the property no later than January 1, 1997, Beus expended funds to open the dealership on that date, including entering into agreements with the local redevelopment agency, obtaining loans from Isuzu, and paying for the demolition of the buildings on the rear lot. Beus also ordered an inventory of new Isuzu vehicles to be delivered to the new dealership.\n",
       "\n",
       "While waiting to occupy the main portion of the lot, Beus moved into the vacant back lot, and stored the new Isuzu vehicles at this lot. On December 28, 1996, Beus representatives attempted to take possession of the front portion of the lot. But Holland representatives said that Holland would not vacate the premises for another two weeks. In the succeeding six weeks, Beus made numerous demands for possession of the front portion of the Johnson property, receiving in return a series of promises and representations from Cunningham and others that Holland would vacate the premises by certain dates. Meanwhile, Beus attempted to “operate out of a damp, tin building remaining on the rear lot portion of the premises with no phones, no electricity, and no plumbing.” Because of its inability to move into the front lot, Beus was unable to obtain a sales license from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and thus was unable to"

Cal. 2003)                            | Does damage to a leasehold interest constitute \"property damage\" as defined in insurance policy terms, specifically in cases where the tenant has not yet taken possession of the property?                                    | A tenant’s right to possess property on the lease commencement date is a contractual right that does not mature into a property right until possession actually occurs. A landlord's failure to deliver possession merely gives the tenant a right to abandon the tenancy and sue for damages, but does not grant the tenant the legal right to act as a possessor of the real property until actual transfer. Therefore, damage to a leasehold interest, in cases where possession has not occurred, does not constitute damage to a tangible property right. | In the context of insurance policies specifying coverage for \"property damage\" limited to \"tangible property,\" damage to a leasehold interest, where the tenant has not yet taken possession, falls outside the scope of property damage. This is due to the characterization of a tenant’s interest prior to possession as a contractual rather than a tangible property right.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The citation was used to support the argument that damage to a leasehold interest, prior to the tenant taking possession, does not constitute 'property damage' under the defined terms of an insurance policy. It clarifies the legal status of a leasehold interest as initially a contractual right, which does not transform into a tangible property right until actual possession occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

It was used to strengthen the court's reasoning for granting summary judgment in favor of Hartford, indicating that F&H failed to establish it suffered property damage within the meaning of the CGLI policy issued by Hartford. |\n",

Any ambiguity or doubt concerning the duty to defend should be resolved in favor of the insured, indicating a preference towards granting coverage or defense under the policy unless it is clearly unwarranted. | The case was cited to support the principle that, when an insurer moves for summary judgment based on the claim of no coverage or an exclusion, the insurer has the burden to unequivocally prove that the claim cannot possibly fit within the scope of the policy coverage or definitely falls within an exclusion.

Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> . The clear implication of the Cunningham court’s reasoning is that when a tenant legally takes possession of the premises, the tenant, unlike an easement holder or a nonpossessing tenant, has a possessory property right in the premises. As such, a tenant in possession presumably has a tangible property interest in the premises and can assert claims for property damage, as defined in the insurance contract. Regardless, this argument is not dispositive in the instant case, since the Court finds that R & H has asserted claims for personal injury that extend beyond property damage. . Plaintiffs have also argued that the allegations in the Underlying Complaint cannot be claims for \"property damage,” since the property damage section of the policy applies only to \"tangible property.” Plaintiffs argue that a leasehold interest is not \"tangible property” and therefore damage to a leasehold interest is not property damage as defined in the policy.

A landlord's failure to deliver possession of the premises merely gives the tenant a right to abandon the tenancy and sue for damages, but does not give the tenant the legal right to act as a possessor of the real property until the date of actual transfer.” <a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\" title=\"120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 162, 1155\">Id. at 1155</a>-1156, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\" title=\"120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> . The clear implication of the Cunningham court’s reasoning is that when a tenant legally takes possession of the premises, the tenant, unlike an easement holder or a nonpossessing tenant, has a possessory property right in the premises. As such, a tenant in possession presumably has a tangible property interest in the premises and can assert claims for property damage, as defined in the insurance contract. Regardless, this argument is not dispositive in the instant case, since the Court finds that R & H has asserted claims for personal injury that extend beyond property damage. Kazi v.

       "Coverage: Which limit applies? 2 2 ' Part IV of appellants’ policy is entitled “Uninsured Motorists Coverage.” In it, Mercury promises to pay “all sums which the insured . . . shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner, or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the . . . use of such uninsured motor vehicles . . . .” ' The next part of the policy, titled “Part IV—Conditions,” includes the provision that “The limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to ‘each person’ is the limit of the company’s liability for all damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person in any one accident.... For the purposes of this provision, the ‘bodily injury sustained by any one person’ as used herein, shall be deemed to include all injury and damages for care, loss of consortium and injury to any interpersonal relationship sustained by others as a consequence of such bodily injury.” The second quoted sentence is in boldface. At summary judgment, Mercury contended that the unambiguous language of this clause meant that the per person limit of $15,000, not the per accident limit of $30,000, applies to appellants’ claims. Appellants make two claims, that the per accident limit applies under the terms of the policy and that the per accident limit must apply, because Insurance Code section 11580.2 mandates that it does. As to the policy itself, we agree with Mercury that the language is unambiguous. We thus give effect to its plain meaning (Cunningham v. *1202 Universal Underwriters (2002) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141#p1149\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal.

Abellon, like Warner, is a declaratory relief action filed by an insurer after its insured was in a car accident and was sued not only by the other driver, but by that driver’s spouse on a loss of consortium claim. Neither case involves uninsured motorist coverage, but in both cases, the insurer sought a declaration that the per person, not the per accident, limit of the liability coverage applied. Warner found that the per person limit applied, and Abellon found that the per accident limit applied. However, in Warner, the policy language was like the language before us, 3 and in Abellon there was no similar language defining “bodily injury to any one person” to include the loss of consortium sustained by another. Instead, the insured in Abellon case had “no notice when it purchased the policy that loss of consortium damages fell within the purview of the ‘per person’ limitation.” (Abellon, at p. 31.) Abellon does not help us construe appellants’ policy. Abellon v. Hartford Ins.

E. Loss of Use of Tangible Property Loss of Use of Tangible Property We next consider whether F&H suffered “property damage” under the second definition of that term, i.e. “[ljoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.” The court in Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at page 818, explained the meaning of the phrase “loss of use,” quoting from 23 California Jurisprudence Third: “ ‘The measure of damages for the loss of use of personal property may be determined with reference to the rental value of similar property which the plaintiff can hire for use during the period when he is deprived of the use of his own property.’ (23 Cal.Jur.3d, Damages, § 69, pp. 129-130 . . . .)” (Italics omitted.) Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., supra, F&H does not seek damages for the rental value (or its equivalent) for the loss of the use of the Los Vaqueros facility during the time period modifications were made to the pile caps, or even for a period of time caused by delay. The likely reason for this is the fact the project was completed on time. As noted, the only costs claimed by F&H are the costs for repairing and modifying the defective caps and for loss of the early completion bonus. Those costs are unrelated to rental value. F&H has therefore failed to establish its damages are covered by the policy as “property damage.” A contrary conclusion would allow contractors and developers to obtain liability insurance for inferior or defective workmanship, a risk not covered by commercial liability insurance.

       "sub judice. 2 2 any *555 Our review of Maryland case law has disclosed no definition of “actual eviction.” Black’s Law Dictionary 35 (6th ed.1990) defines actual eviction as “[a]n actual expulsion of the tenant out of all or some part of the demised premises. A physical ouster or dispossession from the very thing granted or some substantial part thereof.” (Emphasis added). Thompson on Real Property § 41.03(c)(2), entitled “Actual Eviction by the Landlord,” explains: dispossession from the very thing granted or some substantial part thereof.” The landlord will be in breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment if the landlord, or someone for whose acts the landlord is responsible, wrongfully ousts the tenant from the leased premises. The cases refer to this conduct, which can take the form of physical expulsion or a physical exclusion of the tenant from the leased premises, as an actual eviction. Particular acts by the landlord that have been found to be sufficient to constitute actual eviction of a tenant have included changing the locks on the leased premises, refusing to permit the tenant to enter a building in which space has been leased, padlocking the entry to the leased premises, and taking possession of the leased premises with threats of violence against the tenant or members of the tenant’s family if they attempt to reenter. The cases also recognize that the landlord’s eviction efforts may deprive the tenant of only a portion of the leased premises, leaving the tenant in possession of the remainder. If the landlord deprives the tenant of a significant portion of the leased premises, the landlord’s conduct will generally be regarded as constituting a partial actual eviction, and a breach of the implied covenant.

The Guntert court recognized that a tenant has alternative remedies to respond to the landlord’s interference and, instead of vacating, may “stand upon the lease and sue for damages.” (<a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr./126/690\" title=\"126 Cal. Rptr. 690, 140\">Id. at p. 140</a>.) In Guntert, the plaintiff tenant had not quit the premises, despite the landlord’s service of an invalid and bad faith eviction notice. The court thus concluded: “[The tenant] is not suing for a wrongful, constructive eviction but for the lessor’s unjustified and unauthorized interference with his profitable use of the leased property. The rule requiring ouster or surrender prior to suit for wrongful eviction does not preclude the tenant from his election to stand upon the lease, remain in possession and sue for breach of contract damages.” (<a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr./126/690\" title=\"126 Cal.

Rptr. 690\">Id.</a> Subsequent cases have similarly drawn a distinction between a wrongful eviction claim, and one in which the tenant remains in possession of the premises and sues for damages arising out of the landlord’s interference with the tenant’s beneficial use of the leased premises. For example, in Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters (2002) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal. App. 4th 1141\">98 Cal.App.4th 1141</a></a> , 1153 [ <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\" title=\"120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> ], the court explained: “While a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is similar to a constructive eviction claim, the critical difference is that the latter claim may not be brought until the tenant has vacated the property.” Thus, breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment can be understood as a title encompassing claims for wrongful eviction, and also claims in which the tenant’s use of the premises is disturbed, but the tenant remains in possession. Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal.

Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> b. Courts have only attached tort liability to wrongful eviction claims Courts have only attached tort liability to wrongful eviction claims It is true, as Ginsberg asserts, that some courts have implicitly or explicitly indicated a tenant may recover punitive damages in connection with a claim for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, or identified the claim as a tort. However, all of those cases describe wrongful eviction claims. In other words, they are cases in which the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment *899 is breached by a wrongful eviction. For example, Ginsberg relies on Barkett v. Brucato (1953) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/122/264\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/122/264\" title=\"122 Cal.

In Barkett, the landlord engaged in a series of egregious acts intended to force the residential tenants to vacate the premises, such as authorizing the removal of the building’s roof during the rainy season, leading to extensive flooding in the tenants’ apartment. (Id. at pp. 271-272.) The tenants eventually vacated the flat. (Id. at p. 272.) They then filed suit, alleging claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, and “conspiracy to willfully and maliciously harass” the tenants. (Id. at p. 266.) A jury returned a general verdict against the landlord, and awarded $5,000 in damages, but did not award any punitive damages. (Ibid.) *899 Barkett Brucato\n",

Rather, it is whether an insured, reading his or her policy, would understand \"tangible property\" to include real property that he or she leases. If your leased apartment was rendered uninhabitable by some noxious stench, you would conclude that you had lost the use of tangible property; and if a lawyer said no, actually you had merely lost the use of your intangible lease, you would goggle in disbelief.

Rptr. 2d 808\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 808</a></a> The defendants also suggest that the state complaint's references to \"personal injury\" and other enumerated torts extend the eviction into the policy period. 37 In their reply, they elaborate: 37 The policy covers damages that arise out of property damage, mental or bodily injury, shock, sickness, disease or death, or injury that arises out of false arrest, false imprisonment, wrongful eviction, wrongful detention, malicious prosecution, libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of the rights of privacy (so long as not thereafter excluded). By grouping all of these potential liability claims together, GEICO purposefully declined to separate them, and provide a separate trigger for each. 38 arise out of 38 They cite no authority to support the argument. Again, coverage is based on when *928 the \"offense is committed.\" Here, at minimum, that is when the tenants departed or when the defendants regained possession of the property.

For example, for the tort of malicious prosecution, insurance-coverage cases hold that -- for purposes of insurance policies that measure coverage from the time when the \"offense is committed\" -- the tort of malicious prosecution occurs when the complaint is filed.

       "<p>Coverage: Which limit applies? 2 2 ' Part IV of appellants’ policy is entitled “Uninsured Motorists Coverage.” In it, Mercury promises to pay “all sums which the insured . . . shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner, or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the . . . use of such uninsured motor vehicles . . . .” ' The next part of the policy, titled “Part IV—Conditions,” includes the provision that “The limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to ‘each person’ is the limit of the company’s liability for all damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person in any one accident.... For the purposes of this provision, the ‘bodily injury sustained by any one person’ as used herein, shall be deemed to include all injury and damages for care, loss of consortium and injury to any interpersonal relationship sustained by others as a consequence of such bodily injury.” The second quoted sentence is in boldface. At summary judgment, Mercury contended that the unambiguous language of this clause meant that the per person limit of $15,000, not the per accident limit of $30,000, applies to appellants’ claims. Appellants make two claims, that the per accident limit applies under the terms of the policy and that the per accident limit must apply, because Insurance Code section 11580.2 mandates that it does. As to the policy itself, we agree with Mercury that the language is unambiguous. We thus give effect to its plain meaning (Cunningham v. <em>1202 Universal Underwriters (2002) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141#p1149\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal.

Warner (1976) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/64/957\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/64/957\" title=\"64 Cal.

Abellon, like Warner, is a declaratory relief action filed by an insurer after its insured was in a car accident and was sued not only by the other driver, but by that driver’s spouse on a loss of consortium claim. Neither case involves uninsured motorist coverage, but in both cases, the insurer sought a declaration that the per person, not the per accident, limit of the liability coverage applied. Warner found that the per person limit applied, and Abellon found that the per accident limit applied. However, in Warner, the policy language was like the language before us, 3 and in Abellon there was no similar language defining “bodily injury to any one person” to include the loss of consortium sustained by another. Instead, the insured in Abellon case had “no notice when it purchased the policy that loss of consortium damages fell within the purview of the ‘per person’ limitation.” (Abellon, at p. 31.) Abellon does not help us construe appellants’ policy. Abellon v. Hartford Ins.

       "<p><em>377 Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., supra, Traveler’s We therefore hold that welding the lower grade pile caps to the driven piles does not constitute physical injury to tangible property where the only injury shown is the welded structure’s failure to perform as intended. E. Loss of Use of Tangible Property Loss of Use of Tangible Property We next consider whether F&amp;H suffered “property damage” under the second definition of that term, i.e. “[ljoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.” The court in Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at page 818, explained the meaning of the phrase “loss of use,” quoting from 23 California Jurisprudence Third: “ ‘The measure of damages for the loss of use of personal property may be determined with reference to the rental value of similar property which the plaintiff can hire for use during the period when he is deprived of the use of his own property.’ (23 Cal.Jur.3d, Damages, § 69, pp. 129-130 . . . .)” (Italics omitted.) Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co., supra, F&amp;H does not seek damages for the rental value (or its equivalent) for the loss of the use of the Los Vaqueros facility during the time period modifications were made to the pile caps, or even for a period of time caused by delay. The likely reason for this is the fact the project was completed on time. As noted, the only costs claimed by F&amp;H are the costs for repairing and modifying the defective caps and for loss of the early completion bonus. Those costs are unrelated to rental value. F&amp;H has therefore failed to establish its damages are covered by the policy as “property damage.” A contrary conclusion would allow contractors and developers to obtain liability insurance for inferior or defective workmanship, a risk not covered by commercial liability insurance.

       "<p>sub judice. 2 2 any <em>555 Our review of Maryland case law has disclosed no definition of “actual eviction.” Black’s Law Dictionary 35 (6th ed.1990) defines actual eviction as “[a]n actual expulsion of the tenant out of all or some part of the demised premises. A physical ouster or dispossession from the very thing granted or some substantial part thereof.” (Emphasis added). Thompson on Real Property § 41.03(c)(2), entitled “Actual Eviction by the Landlord,” explains: dispossession from the very thing granted or some substantial part thereof.” The landlord will be in breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment if the landlord, or someone for whose acts the landlord is responsible, wrongfully ousts the tenant from the leased premises. The cases refer to this conduct, which can take the form of physical expulsion or a physical exclusion of the tenant from the leased premises, as an actual eviction. Particular acts by the landlord that have been found to be sufficient to constitute actual eviction of a tenant have included changing the locks on the leased premises, refusing to permit the tenant to enter a building in which space has been leased, padlocking the entry to the leased premises, and taking possession of the leased premises with threats of violence against the tenant or members of the tenant’s family if they attempt to reenter. The cases also recognize that the landlord’s eviction efforts may deprive the tenant of only a portion of the leased premises, leaving the tenant in possession of the remainder. If the landlord deprives the tenant of a significant portion of the leased premises, the landlord’s conduct will generally be regarded as constituting a partial actual eviction, and a breach of the implied covenant.

City of Stockton (1976) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/55/131\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/55/131\" title=\"55 Cal.

Rptr. 690\">126 Cal.Rptr. 690</a></a> ] (Guntert), the court distinguished claims in which the landlord has actually or constructively ousted the tenant from those in which the landlord’s interference with the tenant’s enjoyment or use of the property does not lead to ouster. The Guntert court recognized that a tenant has alternative remedies to respond to the landlord’s interference and, instead of vacating, may “stand upon the lease and sue for damages.” (<a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr./126/690\" title=\"126 Cal. Rptr. 690, 140\">Id. at p. 140</a>.) In Guntert, the plaintiff tenant had not quit the premises, despite the landlord’s service of an invalid and bad faith eviction notice. The court thus concluded: “[The tenant] is not suing for a wrongful, constructive eviction but for the lessor’s unjustified and unauthorized interference with his profitable use of the leased property. The rule requiring ouster or surrender prior to suit for wrongful eviction does not preclude the tenant from his election to stand upon the lease, remain in possession and sue for breach of contract damages.” (<a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr./126/690\" title=\"126 Cal.

Rptr. 690\">Id.</a> Subsequent cases have similarly drawn a distinction between a wrongful eviction claim, and one in which the tenant remains in possession of the premises and sues for damages arising out of the landlord’s interference with the tenant’s beneficial use of the leased premises. For example, in Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters (2002) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal.

Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> ], the court explained: “While a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is similar to a constructive eviction claim, the critical difference is that the latter claim may not be brought until the tenant has vacated the property.” Thus, breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment can be understood as a title encompassing claims for wrongful eviction, and also claims in which the tenant’s use of the premises is disturbed, but the tenant remains in possession. Cunningham v. Universal Underwriters <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/1141\" title=\"98 Cal.

Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> b. Courts have only attached tort liability to wrongful eviction claims Courts have only attached tort liability to wrongful eviction claims It is true, as Ginsberg asserts, that some courts have implicitly or explicitly indicated a tenant may recover punitive damages in connection with a claim for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, or identified the claim as a tort. However, all of those cases describe wrongful eviction claims. In other words, they are cases in which the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment <em>899 is breached by a wrongful eviction. For example, Ginsberg relies on Barkett v. Brucato (1953) <a href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/122/264\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/122/264\" title=\"122 Cal.

In Barkett, the landlord engaged in a series of egregious acts intended to force the residential tenants to vacate the premises, such as authorizing the removal of the building’s roof during the rainy season, leading to extensive flooding in the tenants’ apartment. (Id. at pp. 271-272.) The tenants eventually vacated the flat. (Id. at p. 272.) They then filed suit, alleging claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, and “conspiracy to willfully and maliciously harass” the tenants. (Id. at p. 266.) A jury returned a general verdict against the landlord, and awarded $5,000 in damages, but did not award any punitive damages. (Ibid.) </em>899 Barkett Brucato</p>\n",

Rather, it is whether an insured, reading his or her policy, would understand \"tangible property\" to include real property that he or she leases. If your leased apartment was rendered uninhabitable by some noxious stench, you would conclude that you had lost the use of tangible property; and if a lawyer said no, actually you had merely lost the use of your intangible lease, you would goggle in disbelief. Most important, though, our view on this point is dictum, because our case is distinguishable. Here, Sombrero is the owner of the property, not a lessee.

Rptr. 2d 808\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 808</a></a> The defendants also suggest that the state complaint's references to \"personal injury\" and other enumerated torts extend the eviction into the policy period. 37 In their reply, they elaborate: 37 The policy covers damages that arise out of property damage, mental or bodily injury, shock, sickness, disease or death, or injury that arises out of false arrest, false imprisonment, wrongful eviction, wrongful detention, malicious prosecution, libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of the rights of privacy (so long as not thereafter excluded). By grouping all of these potential liability claims together, GEICO purposefully declined to separate them, and provide a separate trigger for each. 38 arise out of 38 They cite no authority to support the argument. Again, coverage is based on when <em>928 the \"offense is committed.\" Here, at minimum, that is when the tenants departed or when the defendants regained possession of the property.

App. 4th at 1149 , <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\"><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/c/Cal.%20Rptr.%202d/120/162\" title=\"120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 162\">120 Cal.Rptr.2d 162</a></a> . The same is true for the other enumerated torts. For example, for the tort of malicious prosecution, insurance-coverage cases hold that -- for purposes of insurance policies that measure coverage from the time when the \"offense is committed\" -- the tort of malicious prosecution occurs when the complaint is filed.

These events happened before May 8, 2018, the effective date of the GEICO policy. 39 CONCLUSION</p>\n",
