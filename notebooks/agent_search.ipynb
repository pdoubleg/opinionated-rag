In some states, individuals who own a mobile home in a park may face restrictions on using medical marijuana on the park's property, even if they own their home outright. This can lead to conflicts between property rights and medical needs. Additionally, in the context of employment, discrimination against medical marijuana patients can occur, as seen in the case of a healthcare worker in New York who faced job discrimination after disclosing their medical marijuana patient status. This highlights the complex legal landscape surrounding medical marijuana use, where state laws, employment regulations, and individual rights intersect."

       "'Hello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.'"

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new\\njob at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a\\nmedical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went\\nto get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana\\ncard and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is\\nthis legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor\\ndepartment and they said I may or may not have a case.  Hello,  I was\\nconsidering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with\\nthis chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not\\nfeel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so\\nhopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure\\nabout drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but\\nI\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be\\nwith medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to\\ndo so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug\\ntesting during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test.   Will I get fired\\nor fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to\\ndismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an\\nannoying question or something.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my\\nwork get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does\\nnot get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they\\njust don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not\\nfederally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get\\nselected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or\\ndo I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance\\nif I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or\\nanything.  Asking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in\\nCalifornia.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions\\nso he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even\\nthough he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or\\nbring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal\\nmedical grounds for him?    So to start: I’m not the employee that would be\\nbreathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30\\npeople. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been\\ndrinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some\\nproduction staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned\\nthe owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should\\nthey appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need\\nto take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s mentioned in our\\nhandbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working\\nhours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless\\nnecessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely\\nprohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by\\ncase basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers\\noften for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so curious than\\nanything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did\\noccur if it’s legal or not .  Throwaway account for obvious reasons, I just\\ngraduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked\\nweed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i\\nreturned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a drug\\nscreening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked regularly\\n(daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing company or\\njust ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug test\\nshould I try to do so?    I recently started working at a small manufacturing\\ncompany in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that\\nthere would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the\\nlegality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random\\ndrug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do\\nnot qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal?\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?  My\\nroommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of\\npeople, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant\\nlegally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not\\nwant to go to management about it because I have been harassed and threatened by\\nmanagement before and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my\\nlease as it is against the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease\\nsays that they reserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of\\nthe building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the\\napartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and\\nthat they will charge anyone within the residence whether or not they can\\nestablish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do about this that\\nwont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?  This is in Iowa.\\nMy employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good\\nnews for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began\\nresearching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code\\n730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking\\nthe test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that\\na police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were\\nin the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of\\nIowa?   Any insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy\\nwatching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place.\\nNot an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   Is that legal\\ndiscrimination?  maybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to\\nbuild an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of\\ndry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my\\nquestion is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the\\nproduct. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of\\nthe product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most\\nparaphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a\\nvideo presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to\\ninclude mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i\\nlive in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on\\nmoving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it\\nis illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to\\nmarijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing\\nand shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  If my boss\\nknows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he\\nfire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I already asked\\nthis question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident\\nand we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my\\nconcealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries\\nand buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL\\nand/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23\\nbut has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am\\nonly BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive\\nrepercussions?  I was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer\\ndeemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for\\nauthorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be\\ntransitioned back into the workplace.  Am I required to do this to retain my\\njob?  I applied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview\\nprocess involves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m\\nprescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my\\ndoctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis.   The job asked me if it was\\npossible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps\\nme function. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me\\nstating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are\\nunable to hire you.”  I’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no\\nissues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My\\nmedications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a\\nvehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have\\nnever made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel\\nincompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was\\ndiscrimination.   I don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is\\ndiscrimination. Was this discrimination?  My employer recently went through\\nstructural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an email that\\nwent out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In this new\\nprogram, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty dollars a\\ncheck for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to come in on\\nmy day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points you can get\\nfor things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those aren’t\\neffective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can my employer institute this\\npolicy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I have to go in on a\\nday off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri\\nschedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating\\n12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental\\nhealth that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am\\nrendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears\\noff. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  MICHIGAN: I was fired today, after\\nmy coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a\\njanitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the\\npark during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when\\nI went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This\\nis what I texted “Can you get me in a few” “You should bring some weed there’s\\nno one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one” “Damn I\\nthought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I ended up\\nwalking home, because I couldn’t get a ride. My boss who is the director of the\\npark, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed\\nthe fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions\\nof sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he\\nsaid I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been\\nhaving friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing,\\nmy friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video\\nfootage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city\\nmanager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the\\ndirector of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and\\nexpunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in\\nthe same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA\\nplea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed\\nthat i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was\\nbasically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring\\nweed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They\\nreviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not.\\nThere’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove\\nin or not.  He also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist\\nif I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one\\nday last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an\\nMRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He\\nalso said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked,\\n“before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if\\nyou’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a\\ntraumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than\\nthat no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work?\\nThat alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not\\ndrive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take\\nthe car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places.\\nAnd I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My\\nboss, and I have never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for\\n“conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed\\nis legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE\\nPARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than\\nlosing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the\\nassistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA\\nthe Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.  My\\nboss has installed cameras throughout the office capable of recording audio as\\nwell as visual. Is this legal? Can the conversations be used against for\\ntermination or disciplinary action?   ---        Use the above context and any\\nbackground question + answer pairs to answer the question:   What legal\\nchallenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?'</span>\n",

I never did such a thing,\\nmy friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video\\nfootage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city\\nmanager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the\\ndirector of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and\\nexpunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in\\nthe same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA\\nplea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed\\nthat i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was\\nbasically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring\\nweed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They\\nreviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not.\\nThere’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove\\nin or not.  He also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist\\nif I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one\\nday last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an\\nMRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He\\nalso said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked,\\n“before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if\\nyou’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a\\ntraumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than\\nthat no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work?\\nThat alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not\\ndrive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take\\nthe car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places.\\nAnd I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My\\nboss, and I have never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for\\n“conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed\\nis legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE\\nPARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than\\nlosing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the\\nassistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA\\nthe Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.  My\\nboss has installed cameras throughout the office capable of recording audio as\\nwell as visual. Is this legal? Can the conversations be used against for\\ntermination or disciplinary action?   ---        Use the above context and any\\nbackground question + answer pairs to answer the question:   What legal\\nchallenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?'\u001b[0m\n"

These challenges arise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana use.\\n\\n2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken against them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their underlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.\\n\\n3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The legality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary by state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.\\n\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the use of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be prohibited regardless of an employee's medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, especially if an employer discloses an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns about whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\n\\n7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of employees under state law.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n9. **Housing and Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in certain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the use of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee's ability to use medical marijuana.\\n\\n10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical marijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state. Employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations. Legal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.\\n\"</span>\n",

I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new\\njob at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a\\nmedical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went\\nto get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana\\ncard and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is\\nthis legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor\\ndepartment and they said I may or may not have a case.  I have my medical\\nmarijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at\\nit\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been\\nlooking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and\\nknow its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania\\nand how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke\\nbefore or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the\\nlegality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I\\nhappen to fail the test.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the\\nemployer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first\\ntime on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Hello,\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt\\nwith this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug\\ntested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get\\ntested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t\\ntest mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know\\nI\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get\\ntested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before\\nthey can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my\\njob so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.  Throwaway\\naccount for obvious reasons, I just graduated (BS biology) and got back from\\nvacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking\\nemployment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing\\ncompany and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not\\npass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell\\nthe staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for\\nfailing a drug test should I try to do so?    Asking this for a friend who lives\\nin a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card\\nfor his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is\\ntelling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s\\nland he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this\\nor is there some legal medical grounds for him?    So to start: I’m not the\\nemployee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for\\na small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the\\nteam has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees\\nbut some production staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager\\nmentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were\\ndrunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test\\nwhere you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s\\nmentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs\\nduring working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be\\nrefrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and\\nalcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be\\nserved on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who\\nattend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so\\ncurious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know,\\nif this did occur if it’s legal or not .  I applied to a small private transport\\ncompany. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came\\npositive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave\\nthe company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis.\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said\\nno because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still.\\nThen, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated\\nwith your medications, we are unable to hire you.”  I’ve volunteered in 911 EMS\\nfor a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state\\ncertification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair\\nability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough-\\neven though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been\\ntaking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the\\ncompany did was discrimination.   I don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless\\nit actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?  This is in Iowa. My\\nemployer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news\\nfor me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching\\nmy rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says\\nthat employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the\\nemployee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the\\nemployee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a\\nprevious round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police\\nofficer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the\\nbathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa?\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy watching\\nwas a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an\\nactual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   I recently started working at a\\nsmall manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist.\\nMy boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been\\nlooking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best\\nunderstanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more\\ndangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug\\ntest for me be legal?   Also, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test\\ncould I be fired?  maybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying\\nto build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line\\nof dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my\\nquestion is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the\\nproduct. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of\\nthe product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most\\nparaphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a\\nvideo presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to\\ninclude mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i\\nlive in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on\\nmoving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it\\nis illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to\\nmarijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing\\nand shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  If my boss\\nknows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he\\nfire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I already asked\\nthis question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident\\nand we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my\\nconcealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries\\nand buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL\\nand/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23\\nbut has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am\\nonly BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive\\nrepercussions?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID,\\nmy supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun\\na time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one\\nof the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related\\ntasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA\\npaperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will\\nbe told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are\\nthere any actions I can take regarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  Hi All,\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on. I am in HR, but I am still\\ngetting experienced, so I wanted to run this by some other professionals,\\nincluding you legal folk.  I just received a job offer today for a job that I\\ncannot wait to take. Regardless of the verbiage, I will take it; however, I\\nreally dislike it and think that maybe I could help clean it up a bit.\\nTermination. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be\\nterminated immediately at the option of Employer on the occurrence of any one of\\nthe following events:  * Death of Employee  * Employee becomes mentally or\\nphysically disabled. Employee shall be deemed to be mentally or physically\\ndisabled if he is prevented from performing his duties hereunder for a\\ncontinuous period of ten (10) weeks or an aggregate period of twelve (12) weeks\\nduring any sixteen (16) week period during which this Agreement is in effect\\nFor Cause\" which shall mean:  * conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or\\nnolo contendere to a felony or other crime which has or may have a material\\nadverse effect on Employee’s ability to carry out his duties under this\\nAgreement or upon the reputation of Employer;  * a violation by Employee of any\\nof his obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation Sections\\n5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement;  * conduct involving moral turpitude or\\nunprofessional conduct tending to injure the reputation of Employer; material\\nand continuing failure by Employee to perform his duties under this Agreement in\\na quality and professional manner for at least thirty (30) days after written\\nnotice by Employer  * employee otherwise breaches a material provision of this\\nAgreement  So my biggest issues:  * Employee becomes mentally or physically\\ndisabled. Employee shall be deemed to be mentally or physically disabled if he\\nis prevented from performing his duties hereunder for a continuous period of ten\\n(10) weeks or an aggregate period of twelve (12) weeks during any sixteen (16)\\nweek period during which this Agreement is in effect  Doesn\\'t this potentially\\nviolate ADA, and stand in counter with FMLA? This is the one I have the most\\ntrouble with, and would welcome your help.  The second issue is with the next\\nbullet:  For Cause\" which shall mean:  * conviction of or entrance of a plea of\\nguilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime which has or may have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on Employee’s ability to carry out his duties under this\\nAgreement or upon the reputation of Employer;  * a violation by Employee of any\\nof his obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation Sections\\n5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement;  * conduct involving moral turpitude or\\nunprofessional conduct tending to injure the reputation of Employer; material\\nand continuing failure by Employee to perform his duties under this Agreement in\\na quality and professional manner for at least thirty (30) days after written\\nnotice by Employer  * employee otherwise breaches a material provision of this\\nAgreement  PA is an at-will state, so the company has the right to terminate\\nemployment whenever, for whatever cause. Would this be something they are\\nincluding so that if a breach occurs they could produce evidence and not have to\\npay Unemployment? In my experience with PA, judges heavily side with the\\nemployee, even if the employee has done a wrongdoing. Are they really protecting\\nthemselves here?  Your assistance is greatly appreciated.  Hey LegalAdvice,  I\\nlive in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston\\narea. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store once a week, since\\nI am in school.   I went into work last weekend and had noticed that my job\\ntitle, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being\\ntold about this change.   The reason for the change was supposedly due to the\\nposition being given to other members of the store, and that a limited amount of\\nmembers are given the position. The thing is, I was never informed of such a\\nchange and it was a complete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and\\nsee what had changed.  Do I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely\\nlegal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something\\nthat is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say\\nabout this.   If any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching\\nthis post!   Thank you guys.   I\\'m a little unclear as to what I can actually\\nexpect to happen December 1st when the [rewrite goes into effect](http://www.lex\\nology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=50d56525-ba39-4ec0-a5ed-076a1bffe7bd).  I work\\nas a counselor for adults with special needs. My time during the week is paid\\nhourly but if I work a weekend day it\\'s a 24 hour shift that\\'s paid salary.   I\\nknow this is illegal, I\\'m actually in the process of filing a claim with the\\nDept of Labor about it, but if our director decides to abide by this revision in\\nthe regulations what might happen to our weekend days?  MICHIGAN: I was fired\\ntoday, after my coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss\\n(Bob). I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all\\nalone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for\\nmonths, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by\\nmistake. This is what I texted “Can you get me in a few” “You should bring some\\nweed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other\\none” “Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I\\nended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride. My boss who is the\\ndirector of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this\\nmorning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and\\naccountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to\\nrebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my\\nfriend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours\\n“partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up\\nand he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first\\nmeeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the\\nassistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this\\ncity I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as\\na kid (7 years ago) in the same city which holds the record. The file was\\ndismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the\\ncity manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions\\nalone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me\\nup from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the\\npark after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a\\ncar adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they\\ncouldn’t tell if a car drove in or not.  He also told me that he would be able\\nto give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two\\nweeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder,\\ntearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him\\na doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by\\nsaying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything\\nabout you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at\\nthat moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about\\nlast week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t\\nyou ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an\\nemployee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work,\\nso I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually\\nneed a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my\\ncharacter into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before. In the\\nend I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate\\nadvice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET\\nPICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in\\nthe workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether\\nit is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC\\nfile(dismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when\\nconsidering my termination.  Is that legal discrimination?  My roommate smokes a\\nton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often\\nminors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in\\npublic. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to\\nmanagement about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management\\nbefore and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is\\nagainst the leases (We each have our own lease), but the lease says that they\\nreserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide\\nsmoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of\\nmass drug use paraphernalia (including bongs), and that they will charge anyone\\nwithin the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any\\nsuggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of\\nharassment etc by management?   ---        Use the above context and any\\nbackground question + answer pairs to answer the question:   What impact does\\nmedical marijuana use have on employment laws?'</span>\n",

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:        ---   What impact does medical\\nmarijuana use have on employment laws?   ---        Here is any available\\nbackground question + answer pairs:        ---   Question 0: What legal\\nchallenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents several legal\\nchallenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges arise from the\\nconflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal\\nlaws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key\\nlegal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:  1.\\n**Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law\\nas a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is\\nlegally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are\\nstill violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations,\\nespecially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.    ---\\nHere is additional context relevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York\\nState medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new\\njob at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a\\nmedical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went\\nto get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana\\ncard and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is\\nthis legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor\\ndepartment and they said I may or may not have a case.  I have my medical\\nmarijuana card because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at\\nit\\'s joints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been\\nlooking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and\\nknow its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania\\nand how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke\\nbefore or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the\\nlegality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I\\nhappen to fail the test.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the\\nemployer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first\\ntime on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Hello,\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt\\nwith this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug\\ntested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get\\ntested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t\\ntest mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know\\nI\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get\\ntested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before\\nthey can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my\\njob so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.  Throwaway\\naccount for obvious reasons, I just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from\\nvacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking\\nemployment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing\\ncompany and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not\\npass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell\\nthe staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for\\nfailing a drug test should I try to do so?    Asking this for a friend who lives\\nin a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card\\nfor his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is\\ntelling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s\\nland he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this\\nor is there some legal medical grounds for him?    So to start: I’m not the\\nemployee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for\\na small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the\\nteam has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees\\nbut some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager\\nmentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were\\ndrunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test\\nwhere you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s\\nmentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs\\nduring working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be\\nrefrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and\\nalcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be\\nserved on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who\\nattend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so\\ncurious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know,\\nif this did occur if it’s legal or not .  I applied to a small private transport\\ncompany. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my test came\\npositive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave\\nthe company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and diagnosis.\\nThe job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my prescriptions. I said\\nno because it really helps me function. Like I’m not incompetent but still.\\nThen, the employer emailed me stating that “due to liability issues associated\\nwith your medications, we are unable to hire you.”  I’ve volunteered in 911 EMS\\nfor a couple years with no issues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state\\ncertification exam. My medications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair\\nability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough-\\neven though my meds have never made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been\\ntaking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my friends have told me that what the\\ncompany did was discrimination.   I don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless\\nit actually is discrimination. Was this discrimination?  This is in Iowa. My\\nemployer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news\\nfor me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching\\nmy rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says\\nthat employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the\\nemployee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the\\nemployee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a\\nprevious round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police\\nofficer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were in the\\nbathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa?\\nAny insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy watching\\nwas a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an\\nactual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   I recently started working at a\\nsmall manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist.\\nMy boss told me that there would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been\\nlooking up the legality of random drug tests in California and to my best\\nunderstanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees who work more\\ndangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a random drug\\ntest for me be legal?   Also, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test\\ncould I be fired?  maybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying\\nto build an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line\\nof dry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my\\nquestion is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the\\nproduct. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of\\nthe product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most\\nparaphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a\\nvideo presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to\\ninclude mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i\\nlive in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on\\nmoving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it\\nis illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to\\nmarijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing\\nand shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  If my boss\\nknows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he\\nfire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I already asked\\nthis question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident\\nand we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my\\nconcealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries\\nand buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL\\nand/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23\\nbut has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am\\nonly BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive\\nrepercussions?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID,\\nmy supervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun\\na time-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one\\nof the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related\\ntasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA\\npaperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will\\nbe told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are\\nthere any actions I can take regarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  Hi All,\\nI am a PA Resident so you have something to go on. I am in HR, but I am still\\ngetting experienced, so I wanted to run this by some other professionals,\\nincluding you legal folk.  I just received a job offer today for a job that I\\ncannot wait to take. Regardless of the verbiage, I will take it; however, I\\nreally dislike it and think that maybe I could help clean it up a bit.\\nTermination.

Hey LegalAdvice,  I\\nlive in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston\\narea.

I work\\nas a counselor for adults with special needs. My time during the week is paid\\nhourly but if I work a weekend day it\\'s a 24 hour shift that\\'s paid salary.   I\\nknow this is illegal, I\\'m actually in the process of filing a claim with the\\nDept of Labor about it, but if our director decides to abide by this revision in\\nthe regulations what might happen to our weekend days?  MICHIGAN: I was fired\\ntoday, after my coworker, \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlet’s call him Jim\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m shared my text with my boss\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBob\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all\\nalone in the park during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for\\nmonths, when I went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by\\nmistake. This is what I texted “Can you get me in a few” “You should bring some\\nweed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other\\none” “Damn I thought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I\\nended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a ride. My boss who is the\\ndirector of the park, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this\\nmorning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and\\naccountable for my actions of sending the text and I understood I will need to\\nrebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed after park hours with my\\nfriend. He thinks I had been having friends over the park after hours\\n“partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came through to pick me up\\nand he said he would review video footage. He drove to city hall after the first\\nmeeting with the assistant city manager. It may be important to know that the\\nassistant city manager is the director of looking into FOIA requests, in this\\ncity I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as\\na kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in the same city which holds the record. The file was\\ndismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came back from city hall he said the\\ncity manager and him agreed that i had lost his trust to perform my functions\\nalone at night because I was basically trying to invite a friend to come pick me\\nup from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the\\npark after hours. They reviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a\\ncar adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they\\ncouldn’t tell if a car drove in or not.  He also told me that he would be able\\nto give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two\\nweeks, like not coming in one day last week when I dislocated my shoulder,\\ntearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him\\na doctors note and everything. He also said things questioning my character by\\nsaying or asking things liked, “before the text, I already didn’t know anything\\nabout you, who you are, if you’re going through issues or not”, I told him at\\nthat moment I did have a traumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about\\nlast week, but other than that no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t\\nyou ever drive to work? That alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an\\nemployee of your age not drive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work,\\nso I’m not going to take the car away from my family all day when they actually\\nneed a car to go places. And I don’t understand how driving to work takes my\\ncharacter into question. My boss, and I have never had any issues before. In the\\nend I was terminated for “conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate\\nadvice on this, because weed is legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET\\nPICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in\\nthe workplace other than losing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether\\nit is legal for the assistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC\\nfile\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA the Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when\\nconsidering my termination.  Is that legal discrimination?  My roommate smokes a\\nton of pot in his room every day, often with a handful of people, who are often\\nminors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere because he cant legally smoke it in\\npublic. The trouble is, it is hurting my lungs, but I do not want to go to\\nmanagement about it because I have been harassed and threatened by management\\nbefore and I fear eviction with having to pay out the rest of my lease as it is\\nagainst the leases \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mWe each have our own lease\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, but the lease says that they\\nreserve the right to evict based on: multiple infringements of the building-wide\\nsmoking ban, the distribution/use of marijuana in the apartment, the presence of\\nmass drug use paraphernalia \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mincluding bongs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, and that they will charge anyone\\nwithin the residence whether or not they can establish possession/ownership. Any\\nsuggestions on what to do about this that wont put me in further risk of\\nharassment etc by management?   ---        Use the above context and any\\nbackground question + answer pairs to answer the question:   What impact does\\nmedical marijuana use have on employment laws?'\u001b[0m\n"

These challenges arise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana use.\\n\\n2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken against them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their underlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.\\n\\n3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The legality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary by state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.\\n\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the use of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be prohibited regardless of an employee's medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, especially if an employer discloses an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns about whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\n\\n7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of employees under state law.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n9. **Housing and Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in certain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the use of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee's ability to use medical marijuana.\\n\\n10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical marijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state. Employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations. Legal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.\\n\"</span>,\n",

Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital,\\nand they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I\\nwas offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment\\nphysical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that\\nI am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already\\ncontacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I\\nmay or may not have a case.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me\\neat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not\\nso hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m\\nunsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state\\nthing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it\\nseems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and\\nnever intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers\\ncompensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the\\ntest.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to\\nhire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so\\nI hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Hello,  I was considering\\ngetting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this\\nchronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug\\ntested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get\\ntested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t\\ntest mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know\\nI\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get\\ntested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before\\nthey can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my\\njob so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.  Throwaway\\naccount for obvious reasons, I just graduated (BS biology) and got back from\\nvacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking\\nemployment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing\\ncompany and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not\\npass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell\\nthe staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for\\nfailing a drug test should I try to do so?    Asking this for a friend who lives\\nin a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card\\nfor his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is\\ntelling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s\\nland he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this\\nor is there some legal medical grounds for him?    I recently started working at\\na small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce\\nspecialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for\\nemployees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California\\nand to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees\\nwho work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a\\nrandom drug test for me be legal?   Also, if I were to refuse to take the random\\ndrug test could I be fired?  So to start: I’m not the employee that would be\\nbreathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30\\npeople. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been\\ndrinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some\\nproduction staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned\\nthe owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should\\nthey appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need\\nto take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s mentioned in our\\nhandbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working\\nhours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless\\nnecessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely\\nprohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by\\ncase basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers\\noften for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so curious than\\nanything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did\\noccur if it’s legal or not .  I already asked this question but I feel I need to\\nclarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational\\nmarijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I\\nlegally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana\\nand still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT\\nINTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does\\nnot want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and\\nTRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?  This is in\\nIowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not\\ngood news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began\\nresearching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code\\n730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking\\nthe test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that\\na police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were\\nin the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of\\nIowa?   Any insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy\\nwatching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place.\\nNot an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri\\nschedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating\\n12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental\\nhealth that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am\\nrendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears\\noff. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I applied to a small private\\ntransport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my\\ntest came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD\\nand gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and\\ndiagnosis.   The job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my\\nprescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not\\nincompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to\\nliability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on\\nmedications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have\\na note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or\\nmachine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy\\nor tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my\\nfriends have told me that what the company did was discrimination.   I don’t\\nwant to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this\\ndiscrimination?  I was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer\\ndeemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for\\nauthorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be\\ntransitioned back into the workplace.  Am I required to do this to retain my\\njob?  If my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in\\nsick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I\\'m\\non probation for a felony drug offense and normally have to fill out my monthly\\njob search form. I\\'ve been admitted into the hospital for the majority of the\\nmonth, do I still run the risk of violating because I wasn\\'t able to do a job\\nsearch? If not, what do I need to show my probation officer? (Florida)  My\\nemployer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache\\nof the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new\\n“wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we\\nwill be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove\\nwe don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done.\\nNow there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the\\ndiscounts for those aren’t effective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can\\nmy employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment?\\nTwo, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  Is that legal\\ndiscrimination?  I currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my\\ncheck today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why\\nmy check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now\\nrequiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am not able to take a 30 min lunch\\nbreak off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building\\ncertified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal? Everything I\\'ve found\\nonline says they cannot deduct a lunch break unless I am free to leave premesis,\\nwhich I am not. Any information on this issue and advice on course of action\\nwould be appreciated  Hello!  &amp;amp;#x200B;  I could write a novel on this, but I\\nwill try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to best get my\\nquestions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is needed on\\nanything!  \\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months.\\nWhile it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.  \\\\-I\\nhad an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to\\nwork.  \\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to\\nan underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off, but\\nidk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through a\\nlot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent\\nhome from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my\\nhours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They\\nagreed.  \\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as\\ncommunicative as possible about it.   \\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours\\nhave begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents\\nfrom a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to\\nstart back full time immediately.   \\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it\\nconflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about\\nit. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts,\\nthat I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their\\nhand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get\\nthem the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted\\nto ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very\\nhesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I\\nrealized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details\\nabout where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.  \\\\-2 days later,\\nHR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying\\nto set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them\\nuntil 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of\\ndue to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my\\ncondition online (cause bills).  \\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused.\\nThey used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off\\nwork as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before,\\nand I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I\\nfelt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they\\nwanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one\\npoint, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying\\nis, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right.\\nThey then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to\\ngo back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though\\nthat makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten\\nsick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s\\ndefinitely not that simple.  &amp;amp;#x200B;  My question is:...do you think my\\ncompany is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick\\nemployee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate\\nthis feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with.\\nAll I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off.\\nAnd if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing?

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:        ---   Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment?   ---        Here\\nis any available background question + answer pairs:        ---   Question 0:\\nWhat legal challenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace? Answer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents\\nseveral legal challenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges\\narise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use\\nand federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some\\nof the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace:  1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal\\nunder federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if\\nan employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state\\nlaw, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient.

The day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing\\ncompany and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not\\npass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell\\nthe staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for\\nfailing a drug test should I try to do so?    Asking this for a friend who lives\\nin a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a medical marijuana card\\nfor his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is\\ntelling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park\\'s\\nland he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this\\nor is there some legal medical grounds for him?    I recently started working at\\na small manufacturing company in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce\\nspecialist. My boss told me that there would be random drug testing for\\nemployees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug tests in California\\nand to my best understanding random drug tests are only allowed for employees\\nwho work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under that standard. Would a\\nrandom drug test for me be legal?   Also, if I were to refuse to take the random\\ndrug test could I be fired?  So to start: I’m not the employee that would be\\nbreathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30\\npeople. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been\\ndrinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some\\nproduction staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned\\nthe owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should\\nthey appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need\\nto take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s mentioned in our\\nhandbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working\\nhours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless\\nnecessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely\\nprohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by\\ncase basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers\\noften for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so curious than\\nanything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did\\noccur if it’s legal or not .  I already asked this question but I feel I need to\\nclarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have legalized recreational\\nmarijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I\\nlegally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana\\nand still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT\\nINTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does\\nnot want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and\\nTRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?  This is in\\nIowa. My employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not\\ngood news for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began\\nresearching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code\\n730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking\\nthe test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that\\na police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were\\nin the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of\\nIowa?   Any insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy\\nwatching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place.\\nNot an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri\\nschedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating\\n12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental\\nhealth that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am\\nrendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears\\noff. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I applied to a small private\\ntransport company. Part of the interview process involves a drug test and my\\ntest came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for my ADHD\\nand gave the company a note from my doctor explaining my prescription and\\ndiagnosis.   The job asked me if it was possible for me to not take my\\nprescriptions. I said no because it really helps me function. Like I’m not\\nincompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me stating that “due to\\nliability issues associated with your medications, we are unable to hire you.”\\nI’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no issues while on\\nmedications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My medications does have\\na note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a vehicle, vessel, or\\nmachine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have never made me dizzy\\nor tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel incompetent. But my\\nfriends have told me that what the company did was discrimination.   I don’t\\nwant to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is discrimination. Was this\\ndiscrimination?  I was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer\\ndeemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for\\nauthorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be\\ntransitioned back into the workplace.  Am I required to do this to retain my\\njob?  If my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call in\\nsick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I\\'m\\non probation for a felony drug offense and normally have to fill out my monthly\\njob search form. I\\'ve been admitted into the hospital for the majority of the\\nmonth, do I still run the risk of violating because I wasn\\'t able to do a job\\nsearch? If not, what do I need to show my probation officer? \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mFlorida\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  My\\nemployer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache\\nof the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new\\n“wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we\\nwill be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker.

Thanks y’all!\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  Is that legal\\ndiscrimination?  I currently work for a staffing agency, when I picked up my\\ncheck today I noticed I had less hours than usual. When I asked my employer why\\nmy check was off they stated that the business I contracted with was now\\nrequiring them to deduct lunch breaks.

Please free free to ask if more information is needed on\\nanything!  \\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10 months.\\nWhile it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.  \\\\-I\\nhad an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned to\\nwork.  \\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill to\\nan underlying medical condition \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mI have a hunch that the injury set it off, but\\nidk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I pushed through a\\nlot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent\\nhome from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my\\nhours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They\\nagreed.  \\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as\\ncommunicative as possible about it.   \\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours\\nhave begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents\\nfrom a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to\\nstart back full time immediately.   \\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it\\nconflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about\\nit. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts,\\nthat I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their\\nhand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get\\nthem the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted\\nto ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very\\nhesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I\\nrealized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details\\nabout where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.  \\\\-2 days later,\\nHR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying\\nto set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them\\nuntil 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of\\ndue to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my\\ncondition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  \\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused.\\nThey used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off\\nwork as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before,\\nand I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I\\nfelt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they\\nwanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one\\npoint, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying\\nis, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right.\\nThey then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to\\ngo back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though\\nthat makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten\\nsick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s\\ndefinitely not that simple.  &amp;#x200B;  My question is:...do you think my\\ncompany is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick\\nemployee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate\\nthis feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with.\\nAll I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off.\\nAnd if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing?

These challenges arise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana use.\\n\\n2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken against them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their underlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.\\n\\n3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The legality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary by state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.\\n\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the use of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be prohibited regardless of an employee's medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, especially if an employer discloses an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns about whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\n\\n7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of employees under state law.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n9. **Housing and Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in certain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the use of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee's ability to use medical marijuana.\\n\\n10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical marijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state. Employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations. Legal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.\\n\"</span>,\n",

Here are some of the key impacts and considerations:\\n\\n1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many states have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance.

Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may limit an employer's ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a positive test for marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if they are legal medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees who disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), when handling such information.\\n\\n6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.

This can result in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations under the law.\\n\\nIn summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and employees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights and obligations in their jurisdiction.\\n\"</span>,\n",

In the context of New York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the Compassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients. Under this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under the New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL). This means that employers in New York State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who are certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other employee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a federal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate federal law.\\n\\nHowever, even with state-level protections, there are complexities due to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are subject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT). These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.\\n\\nIn the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that receive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may be additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and regulations.\\n\\nRegarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the subsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card, it\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law or safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides some protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the hospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.\\n\\nIn other states, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may be different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana patients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) prohibits most employers from discriminating against registered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana components or metabolites.\\n\\nAs for the federal jobs and positions that are not typically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp products that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a risk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.\\n\\nIn summary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced with federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.\\n'</span>\n",

This creates a conflict for employers who must comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.\\n\\n2. **Disability Discrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may limit an employer's ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a positive test for marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if they are legal medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees who disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such information.\\n\\n6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of employees under state law.\\n\\n7. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n8. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\n9. **Employer Accommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise their accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially in states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n10. **Legal Uncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical marijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can result in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations under the law.\\n\\nIn summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and employees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights and obligations in their jurisdiction.\\n\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "\u001b[2;32m│   \u001b[0m\u001b[32m'Question 2: Are there any specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment?\\nAnswer: Yes, there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and these regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of New York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the Compassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients. Under this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under the New York State Human Rights Law \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mNYSHRL\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. This means that employers in New York State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who are certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other employee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a federal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate federal law.\\n\\nHowever, even with state-level protections, there are complexities due to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are subject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.\\n\\nIn the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that receive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may be additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and regulations.\\n\\nRegarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the subsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card, it\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law or safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides some protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the hospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.\\n\\nIn other states, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may be different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana patients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mAMMA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prohibits most employers from discriminating against registered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana components or metabolites.\\n\\nAs for the federal jobs and positions that are not typically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp products that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a risk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.\\n\\nIn summary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced with federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

These challenges arise from the\\nconflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal\\nlaws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key\\nlegal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:  1.\\n**Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law\\nas a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is\\nlegally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are\\nstill violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations,\\nespecially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act (HIPAA).  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance.

These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace.

This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL).

In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act (AMMA) prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.    ---        Here is\\nadditional context relevant to the question:        ---   Hello,  I was\\nconsidering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with\\nthis chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in\\nhealthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are\\ndiscriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered\\nthe job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical\\nconducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a\\npatient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted\\nthe division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may\\nnot have a case.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not\\nfeel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so\\nhopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure\\nabout drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but\\nI\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be\\nwith medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to\\ndo so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug\\ntesting during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test.   Will I get fired\\nor fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to\\ndismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an\\nannoying question or something.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my\\nwork get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does\\nnot get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they\\njust don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not\\nfederally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get\\nselected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or\\ndo I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance\\nif I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or\\nanything.  So to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s\\nlegal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30 people. We are half\\noffice/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during\\nand or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff (they work\\naround heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting\\na breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal?\\nOr is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that\\nto be administered.   It’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not\\ndrinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while\\nmarijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed\\nby a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work\\nfunctions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure\\nrefers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during\\nthe day then return,   I’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during\\nor at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He\\nwants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get\\noff his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his\\nhome 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the\\nproperty.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds\\nfor him?    Throwaway account for obvious reasons, I just graduated (BS biology)\\nand got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri\\nand I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job\\nthrough a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost\\ncertain I will not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as\\nwell. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal\\nramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?    This is in Iowa.\\nMy employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good\\nnews for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began\\nresearching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code\\n730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking\\nthe test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that\\na police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were\\nin the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of\\nIowa?   Any insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy\\nwatching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place.\\nNot an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   If my boss knows I have an\\nunderlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If\\nnot, and he does, can I take legal action?  I already asked this question but I\\nfeel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have\\nlegalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed\\npistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy\\nrecreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or\\nfirearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has\\nbad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only\\nBUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles\\nworking as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random\\ndrug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug\\ntests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only\\nallowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under\\nthat standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal?   Also, if I were to\\nrefuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?  Is that legal\\ndiscrimination?  My roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often\\nwith a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere\\nbecause he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my\\nlungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been\\nharassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to\\npay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases (We each have our own\\nlease), but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on:\\nmultiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of\\nmarijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia\\n(including bongs), and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether\\nor not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do\\nabout this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  My employer recently went\\nthrough structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an\\nemail that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In\\nthis new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty\\ndollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to\\ncome in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points\\nyou can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those\\naren’t effective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can my employer\\ninstitute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I\\nhave to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!  Company\\npolicy states under reasonable suspicion a urinalysis sample for a 9 panel drug\\ntest is required.  Question: if HR ordered a 10 panel drug test, does this make\\nthem non compliant with their own policies?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri\\nschedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating\\n12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental\\nhealth that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am\\nrendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears\\noff. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  MICHIGAN: I was fired today, after\\nmy coworker, (let’s call him Jim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a\\njanitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the\\npark during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when\\nI went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This\\nis what I texted “Can you get me in a few” “You should bring some weed there’s\\nno one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one” “Damn I\\nthought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I ended up\\nwalking home, because I couldn’t get a ride. My boss who is the director of the\\npark, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed\\nthe fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions\\nof sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he\\nsaid I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been\\nhaving friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing,\\nmy friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video\\nfootage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city\\nmanager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the\\ndirector of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and\\nexpunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in\\nthe same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA\\nplea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed\\nthat i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was\\nbasically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring\\nweed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They\\nreviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not.\\nThere’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove\\nin or not.  He also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist\\nif I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one\\nday last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an\\nMRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He\\nalso said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked,\\n“before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if\\nyou’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a\\ntraumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than\\nthat no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work?\\nThat alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not\\ndrive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take\\nthe car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places.\\nAnd I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My\\nboss, and I have never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for\\n“conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed\\nis legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE\\nPARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than\\nlosing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the\\nassistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA\\nthe Holmes youth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.  Hey\\nthere Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other\\nones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a\\nstore that sells smoking paraphernalia  (pipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-\\ngrinders\" etc...) and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee\\ncounter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant\\nseem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County (the\\ntwo potential areas I would consider operating). The closest store I have seen\\nto this was in Toronto(clearly not NYC or Nassau County LI).  I am currently\\nliving in a student hall of University of London. Someone made a complaint about\\nthe smell of marijuana in the hallway near my room so the members of the\\nbuilding opened my door and went into my room. The senior members of the hall\\nnot only entered, but they also searched the room, opening drawers, cabinets,\\nand bags. Is it legal for them to have searched the premises? They mention in\\nthe handbook the following:   &amp;gt;\"Right of Staff to Enter Rooms  &amp;gt;You will\\nbe given prior notice wherever possible, but this specifically excludes\\ncircumstances where immediate access is required to uphold discipline, for\\nurgent health or safety reasons, or in connection with criminal matters.\"  I\\nthink they had the right to enter my room but not to search the premises. Am I\\nwrong in assuming this was a case of unlawful search? Do I not have rights to\\nany sort of privacy?   After the search, they found marijuana in a bag inside a\\ncabinet stashed at the back. If the search was unlawful, is that evidence then\\nallowed to be used against me?

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:        ---   How does the legality of\\nmedical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?   ---        Here is any\\navailable background question + answer pairs:        ---   Question 0: What\\nlegal challenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace?\\nAnswer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents several legal\\nchallenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges arise from the\\nconflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal\\nlaws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key\\nlegal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:  1.\\n**Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law\\nas a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is\\nlegally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are\\nstill violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations,\\nespecially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mNYSHRL\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. This means that employers in New\\nYork State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who\\nare certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other\\nemployee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a\\nfederal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate\\nfederal law.  However, even with state-level protections, there are complexities\\ndue to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I\\ncontrolled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are\\nsubject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in\\nindustries regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers\\nmay be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting\\nmarijuana use.  In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that\\nreceive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may\\nbe additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and\\nregulations.  Regarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the\\nsubsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card,\\nit\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law\\nor safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides\\nsome protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the\\nhospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.  In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mAMMA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.    ---        Here is\\nadditional context relevant to the question:        ---   Hello,  I was\\nconsidering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with\\nthis chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in\\nhealthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are\\ndiscriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered\\nthe job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical\\nconducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a\\npatient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted\\nthe division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may\\nnot have a case.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me eat, not\\nfeel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not so\\nhopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure\\nabout drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state thing, but\\nI\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be\\nwith medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and never intend to\\ndo so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug\\ntesting during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test.   Will I get fired\\nor fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to\\ndismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an\\nannoying question or something.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my\\nwork get drug tested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does\\nnot get tested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they\\njust don\\'t test mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not\\nfederally. I know I\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get\\nselected to get tested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or\\ndo I quit before they can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance\\nif I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or\\nanything.  So to start: I’m not the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s\\nlegal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30 people. We are half\\noffice/production warehouse. Some of the team has been drinking either during\\nand or before work. Mostly office employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work\\naround heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned the owner potentially getting\\na breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal?\\nOr is it similar to a drug test where you need to take them somewhere for that\\nto be administered.   It’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not\\ndrinking or doing illegal drugs during working hours. It notes that while\\nmarijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless necessary and prescribed\\nby a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work\\nfunctions where alcohol may be served on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure\\nrefers to more office staff who attend local mixers often for lunch or during\\nthe day then return,   I’m more so curious than anything - I don’t drink during\\nor at work but would like to know, if this did occur if it’s legal or not .\\nAsking this for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He\\nwants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get\\noff his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his\\nhome 100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the\\nproperty.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds\\nfor him?    Throwaway account for obvious reasons, I just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nand got back from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri\\nand I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job\\nthrough a staffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost\\ncertain I will not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as\\nwell. Should I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal\\nramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?    This is in Iowa.\\nMy employer recently initiated a random drug testing program. This is not good\\nnews for me as I am an occasional recreational user of marijuana. I began\\nresearching my rights as far as the drug testing and came across Iowa Code\\n730.5. It says that employees have the right to testing done with \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee.\"   My question is, what does this \"regard to the\\nprivacy of the employee\" mean? Are they allowed to watch me urinate while taking\\nthe test? In a previous round of drug tests they did, my co-worker told me that\\na police officer and one of the employees of the company doing the testing were\\nin the bathroom while they were told to urinate. Is this legal in the state of\\nIowa?   Any insight appreciated, thanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy\\nwatching was a  \"former\" police officer who now works at the drug testing place.\\nNot an actual police officer. Sorry for confusion.   If my boss knows I have an\\nunderlying mental health problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If\\nnot, and he does, can I take legal action?  I already asked this question but I\\nfeel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident and we have\\nlegalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my concealed\\npistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries and buy\\nrecreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL and/or\\nfirearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23 but has\\nbad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am only\\nBUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive repercussions?\\nI recently started working at a small manufacturing company in Los Angeles\\nworking as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that there would be random\\ndrug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the legality of random drug\\ntests in California and to my best understanding random drug tests are only\\nallowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do not qualify under\\nthat standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal?   Also, if I were to\\nrefuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?  Is that legal\\ndiscrimination?  My roommate smokes a ton of pot in his room every day, often\\nwith a handful of people, who are often minors. He refuses to smoke elsewhere\\nbecause he cant legally smoke it in public. The trouble is, it is hurting my\\nlungs, but I do not want to go to management about it because I have been\\nharassed and threatened by management before and I fear eviction with having to\\npay out the rest of my lease as it is against the leases \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mWe each have our own\\nlease\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, but the lease says that they reserve the right to evict based on:\\nmultiple infringements of the building-wide smoking ban, the distribution/use of\\nmarijuana in the apartment, the presence of mass drug use paraphernalia\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mincluding bongs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, and that they will charge anyone within the residence whether\\nor not they can establish possession/ownership. Any suggestions on what to do\\nabout this that wont put me in further risk of harassment etc by management?\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  My employer recently went\\nthrough structural changes, and included in the headache of the merger is an\\nemail that went out this week detailing our company’s new “wellness program.” In\\nthis new program, effective at the end of February, we will be charged fifty\\ndollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove we don’t smoke is to\\ncome in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done. Now there are points\\nyou can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the discounts for those\\naren’t effective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can my employer\\ninstitute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment? Two, if I\\nhave to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!  Company\\npolicy states under reasonable suspicion a urinalysis sample for a 9 panel drug\\ntest is required.  Question: if HR ordered a 10 panel drug test, does this make\\nthem non compliant with their own policies?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri\\nschedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on alternating\\n12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for mental\\nhealth that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I am\\nrendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication wears\\noff. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  MICHIGAN: I was fired today, after\\nmy coworker, \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlet’s call him Jim\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m shared my text with my boss \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBob\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I’m a\\njanitor for  a City park. At 11:00 pm Saturday I was working all alone in the\\npark during my shift Saturday night which I have normally done for months, when\\nI went to text my friend to pick me up. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This\\nis what I texted “Can you get me in a few” “You should bring some weed there’s\\nno one else here lol. Come in the exit gate cuz I locked the other one” “Damn I\\nthought I was sending that to my ride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I ended up\\nwalking home, because I couldn’t get a ride. My boss who is the director of the\\npark, and the assistant city manager had a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed\\nthe fact that I lost his trust, I was apologetic and accountable for my actions\\nof sending the text and I understood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he\\nsaid I was smoking weed after park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been\\nhaving friends over the park after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing,\\nmy friend never came through to pick me up and he said he would review video\\nfootage. He drove to city hall after the first meeting with the assistant city\\nmanager. It may be important to know that the assistant city manager is the\\ndirector of looking into FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and\\nexpunged “NON-PUBLIC RECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in\\nthe same city which holds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA\\nplea. When he came back from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed\\nthat i had lost his trust to perform my functions alone at night because I was\\nbasically trying to invite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring\\nweed, and party”, I never had a friend come in the park after hours. They\\nreviewed the video but claimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not.\\nThere’s cameras everywhere so I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove\\nin or not.  He also told me that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist\\nif I hadn’t been performing “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one\\nday last week when I dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an\\nMRI which I will need surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He\\nalso said things questioning my character by saying or asking things liked,\\n“before the text, I already didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if\\nyou’re going through issues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a\\ntraumatic injury to my shoulder which I told you about last week, but other than\\nthat no I’m not going through any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work?\\nThat alone raises questions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not\\ndrive to work.” I LIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take\\nthe car away from my family all day when they actually need a car to go places.\\nAnd I don’t understand how driving to work takes my character into question. My\\nboss, and I have never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for\\n“conduct detrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed\\nis legal in Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE\\nPARK’s parking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than\\nlosing my bosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the\\nassistant city manager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA\\nthe Holmes youth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.  Hey\\nthere Legal advice.  This here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other\\nones on this sub. My question is business law related. Is it legal to open up a\\nstore that sells smoking paraphernalia  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mpipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-\\ngrinders\" etc...\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee\\ncounter and sit-down area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant\\nseem to find any shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthe\\ntwo potential areas I would consider operating\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. The closest store I have seen\\nto this was in Toronto\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mclearly not NYC or Nassau County LI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  I am currently\\nliving in a student hall of University of London. Someone made a complaint about\\nthe smell of marijuana in the hallway near my room so the members of the\\nbuilding opened my door and went into my room. The senior members of the hall\\nnot only entered, but they also searched the room, opening drawers, cabinets,\\nand bags. Is it legal for them to have searched the premises? They mention in\\nthe handbook the following:   &gt;\"Right of Staff to Enter Rooms  &gt;You will\\nbe given prior notice wherever possible, but this specifically excludes\\ncircumstances where immediate access is required to uphold discipline, for\\nurgent health or safety reasons, or in connection with criminal matters.\"  I\\nthink they had the right to enter my room but not to search the premises. Am I\\nwrong in assuming this was a case of unlawful search? Do I not have rights to\\nany sort of privacy?   After the search, they found marijuana in a bag inside a\\ncabinet stashed at the back. If the search was unlawful, is that evidence then\\nallowed to be used against me? Thanks!   ---        Use the above context and\\nany background question + answer pairs to answer the question:   How does the\\nlegality of medical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?'\u001b[0m\n"

These challenges arise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use and federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some of the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the workplace:\\n\\n1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if an employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state law, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal regulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana use.\\n\\n2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken against them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their underlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.\\n\\n3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.\\n\\n4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The legality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary by state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.\\n\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the use of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be prohibited regardless of an employee's medical marijuana patient status.\\n\\n6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, especially if an employer discloses an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns about whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\n\\n7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of employees under state law.\\n\\n8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n9. **Housing and Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in certain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the use of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee's ability to use medical marijuana.\\n\\n10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\nIn summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical marijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state. Employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations. Legal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.\\n\"</span>,\n",

Employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may limit an employer's ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a positive test for marijuana.\\n\\n4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if they are legal medical marijuana patients.\\n\\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees who disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to others in the workplace.

In the context of New York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the Compassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients. Under this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under the New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL). This means that employers in New York State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who are certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other employee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a federal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate federal law.\\n\\nHowever, even with state-level protections, there are complexities due to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are subject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT). These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.\\n\\nIn the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that receive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may be additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and regulations.\\n\\nRegarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the subsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card, it\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law or safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides some protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the hospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.\\n\\nIn other states, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may be different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana patients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) prohibits most employers from discriminating against registered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana components or metabolites.\\n\\nAs for the federal jobs and positions that are not typically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp products that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a risk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.\\n\\nIn summary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced with federal law.

Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles to ensure safety.\\n\\n4. **Disability Discrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical conditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Employers may argue that such policies are necessary to maintain safety and productivity, and they may enforce these policies even in states where medical marijuana is legal.\\n\\n3. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles to ensure safety.\\n\\n4. **Disability Discrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical conditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and since marijuana is illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required to accommodate medical marijuana use. State laws may offer more protection, but this varies by state.\\n\\n5. **Drug Testing**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may limit an employer's ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a positive test for marijuana.\\n\\n6. **Privacy Concerns**: If an employee discloses their medical marijuana use to an employer, there may be concerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such information.\\n\\n7. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\\n\\n8. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.\\n\\nIn summary, the intersection of the legality of medical marijuana with workplace policies is highly complex and varies by jurisdiction. Employers and employees must carefully navigate the patchwork of laws and company policies. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.\\n\"\u001b[0m\n",

Answer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents\\nseveral legal challenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges\\narise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use\\nand federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some\\nof the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace:  1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal\\nunder federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if\\nan employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state\\nlaw, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act (HIPAA).  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation (DOT). These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL). This means that employers in New\\nYork State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who\\nare certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other\\nemployee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a\\nfederal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate\\nfederal law.  However, even with state-level protections, there are complexities\\ndue to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I\\ncontrolled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are\\nsubject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in\\nindustries regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT). These employers\\nmay be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting\\nmarijuana use.  In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that\\nreceive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may\\nbe additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and\\nregulations.  Regarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the\\nsubsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card,\\nit\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law\\nor safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides\\nsome protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the\\nhospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.  In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act (AMMA) prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.   Question 3: How\\ndoes the legality of medical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?\\nAnswer: The legality of medical marijuana intersects with workplace policies in\\na complex and often challenging way due to the varying laws and regulations at\\nthe federal and state levels, as well as the specific policies of individual\\nemployers.  1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana is classified as a Schedule\\nI controlled substance under federal law, making it illegal at the federal\\nlevel. However, many states have legalized medical marijuana, creating a\\nconflict between state and federal laws. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries\\nregulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to maintain\\na drug-free workplace, which includes prohibiting marijuana use, regardless of\\nstate laws.  2. **Workplace Policies**: Employers often have their own drug and\\nalcohol policies, which may include zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace\\npolicies. These policies can apply to all employees, including those who do not\\nperform safety-sensitive duties. Employers may argue that such policies are\\nnecessary to maintain safety and productivity, and they may enforce these\\npolicies even in states where medical marijuana is legal.  3. **Safety-Sensitive\\nPositions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for\\npositions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may\\nbe deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for\\nemployees in these roles to ensure safety.  4. **Disability Discrimination and\\nReasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical\\nconditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with\\nDisabilities Act (ADA). However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and\\nsince marijuana is illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required\\nto accommodate medical marijuana use. State laws may offer more protection, but\\nthis varies by state.  5. **Drug Testing**: Employers with drug testing policies\\nmay face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests\\npositive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users,\\nwhich may limit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based\\nsolely on a positive test for marijuana.  6. **Privacy Concerns**: If an\\nemployee discloses their medical marijuana use to an employer, there may be\\nconcerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription\\ndrug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate\\nprivacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\\n(HIPAA), when handling such information.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and\\nUnemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee\\nwho uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment\\nbenefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8.\\n**Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment\\ncontracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions\\nregarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  In\\nsummary, the intersection of the legality of medical marijuana with workplace\\npolicies is highly complex and varies by jurisdiction. Employers and employees\\nmust carefully navigate the patchwork of laws and company policies. Employees\\nwho use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an\\nattorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana\\nregulations in their specific state.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital,\\nand they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I\\nwas offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment\\nphysical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that\\nI am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already\\ncontacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I\\nmay or may not have a case.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me\\neat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not\\nso hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m\\nunsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state\\nthing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it\\nseems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and\\nnever intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers\\ncompensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the\\ntest.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to\\nhire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so\\nI hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Hello,  I was considering\\ngetting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this\\nchronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug\\ntested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get\\ntested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t\\ntest mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know\\nI\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get\\ntested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before\\nthey can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my\\njob so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.  Asking this\\nfor a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a\\nmedical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain\\nmedicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%,\\nbecause its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can\\nthe park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons, I just graduated (BS biology) and got\\nback from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m\\nseeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a\\nstaffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I\\nwill not pass as I smoked regularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well.\\nShould I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal\\nramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?    So to start: I’m\\nnot the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I\\nwork for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse.\\nSome of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly\\noffice employees but some production staff (they work around heavy machinery).\\nAnother manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if\\nstaff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a\\ndrug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered.\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal\\ndrugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be\\nrefrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and\\nalcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be\\nserved on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who\\nattend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so\\ncurious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know,\\nif this did occur if it’s legal or not .  This is in Iowa. My employer recently\\ninitiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an\\noccasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far\\nas the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have\\nthe right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\"   My\\nquestion is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are\\nthey allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of\\ndrug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the\\nemployees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were\\ntold to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa?   Any insight appreciated,\\nthanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police\\nofficer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer.\\nSorry for confusion.   I recently started working at a small manufacturing\\ncompany in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that\\nthere would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the\\nlegality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random\\ndrug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do\\nnot qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal?\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?  I\\nalready asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old\\nMichigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December\\n1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one\\nof the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will\\nthey take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My\\ngirlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the\\ndispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land\\nme legal punitive repercussions?  If my boss knows I have an underlying mental\\nhealth problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does,\\ncan I take legal action?  Hey LegalAdvice,  I live in the United States,\\nSpecifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student\\nwho works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school.   I went into\\nwork last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay\\n(Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed without me being told about this change.\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to\\nother members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the\\nposition. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a\\ncomplete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had\\nchanged.  Do I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite\\nannoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even\\nslightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post!\\nThank you guys.   I was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer\\ndeemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for\\nauthorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be\\ntransitioned back into the workplace.  Am I required to do this to retain my\\njob?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my\\nsupervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a\\ntime-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one\\nof the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related\\ntasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA\\npaperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will\\nbe told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are\\nthere any actions I can take regarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I\\napplied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process\\ninvolves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed\\nAdderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor\\nexplaining my prescription and diagnosis.   The job asked me if it was possible\\nfor me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me\\nfunction. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me\\nstating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are\\nunable to hire you.”  I’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no\\nissues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My\\nmedications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a\\nvehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have\\nnever made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel\\nincompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was\\ndiscrimination.   I don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is\\ndiscrimination. Was this discrimination?  Is that legal discrimination?  My\\nemployer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache\\nof the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new\\n“wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we\\nwill be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove\\nwe don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done.\\nNow there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the\\ndiscounts for those aren’t effective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can\\nmy employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment?\\nTwo, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  I currently work for a\\nstaffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than\\nusual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the\\nbusiness I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am\\nnot able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being\\nthe only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is\\nthis legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break\\nunless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this\\nissue and advice on course of action would be appreciated  Hello people of\\nLegalAdvice,  I work for a grocery store as a part time worker getting roughly\\n32 hours a week. About a month and a half ago, I got injured while working and\\nhave been on modified duty as of yesterday. I just got cleared and my store\\nmanager and department manager basically told me that I have to compete against\\nthe worker who was filling in for me while I was unable to do my original job. I\\nhave 2 weeks until the decision is made. I won’t be loosing my job, I would be\\ngetting placed in a lesser position which may result in less hours and pay. I’m\\nnot sure if this is legal and I’m not really sire what I should do.

       "\u001b[32m'Here is the question you need to answer:        ---   What are the legal rights\\nand responsibilities regarding medical marijuana and employment?   ---\\nHere is any available background question + answer pairs:        ---   Question\\n0: What legal challenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace? Answer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents\\nseveral legal challenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges\\narise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use\\nand federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some\\nof the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace:  1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal\\nunder federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if\\nan employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state\\nlaw, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mNYSHRL\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. This means that employers in New\\nYork State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who\\nare certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other\\nemployee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a\\nfederal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate\\nfederal law.  However, even with state-level protections, there are complexities\\ndue to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I\\ncontrolled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are\\nsubject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in\\nindustries regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers\\nmay be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting\\nmarijuana use.  In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that\\nreceive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may\\nbe additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and\\nregulations.  Regarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the\\nsubsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card,\\nit\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law\\nor safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides\\nsome protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the\\nhospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.  In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mAMMA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.   Question 3: How\\ndoes the legality of medical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?\\nAnswer: The legality of medical marijuana intersects with workplace policies in\\na complex and often challenging way due to the varying laws and regulations at\\nthe federal and state levels, as well as the specific policies of individual\\nemployers.  1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana is classified as a Schedule\\nI controlled substance under federal law, making it illegal at the federal\\nlevel. However, many states have legalized medical marijuana, creating a\\nconflict between state and federal laws. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries\\nregulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may be required to maintain\\na drug-free workplace, which includes prohibiting marijuana use, regardless of\\nstate laws.  2. **Workplace Policies**: Employers often have their own drug and\\nalcohol policies, which may include zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace\\npolicies. These policies can apply to all employees, including those who do not\\nperform safety-sensitive duties. Employers may argue that such policies are\\nnecessary to maintain safety and productivity, and they may enforce these\\npolicies even in states where medical marijuana is legal.  3. **Safety-Sensitive\\nPositions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for\\npositions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may\\nbe deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for\\nemployees in these roles to ensure safety.  4. **Disability Discrimination and\\nReasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical\\nconditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with\\nDisabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and\\nsince marijuana is illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required\\nto accommodate medical marijuana use. State laws may offer more protection, but\\nthis varies by state.  5. **Drug Testing**: Employers with drug testing policies\\nmay face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests\\npositive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users,\\nwhich may limit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based\\nsolely on a positive test for marijuana.  6. **Privacy Concerns**: If an\\nemployee discloses their medical marijuana use to an employer, there may be\\nconcerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription\\ndrug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate\\nprivacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such information.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and\\nUnemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee\\nwho uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment\\nbenefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8.\\n**Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment\\ncontracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions\\nregarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  In\\nsummary, the intersection of the legality of medical marijuana with workplace\\npolicies is highly complex and varies by jurisdiction. Employers and employees\\nmust carefully navigate the patchwork of laws and company policies. Employees\\nwho use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an\\nattorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana\\nregulations in their specific state.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital,\\nand they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I\\nwas offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment\\nphysical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that\\nI am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already\\ncontacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I\\nmay or may not have a case.  I have my medical marijuana card because mj lets me\\neat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s joints, feel like life is not\\nso hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been looking for new jobs and I\\'m\\nunsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and know its a state-to-state\\nthing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania and how weirdly 50/50 it\\nseems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke before or during work and\\nnever intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the legality of workers\\ncompensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the\\ntest.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to\\nhire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first time on this sub so\\nI hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Hello,  I was considering\\ngetting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this\\nchronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The\\nproblem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our\\nemployees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to\\nsmoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As\\nfor the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.\\nBasically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\"\\nposition because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We\\nhave a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that\\njust because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can\\ndisregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.  I live\\nin Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me\\nhaving a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the\\ntester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my\\nboss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do?   I feel\\nreally defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps\\nme.  Thank you.  I work a federal job. Certain positions at my work get drug\\ntested because of their duties. To my knowledge, my position does not get\\ntested. It\\'s possible for anyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t\\ntest mine. I use CBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know\\nI\\'m taking a risk but I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get\\ntested, should I just go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before\\nthey can fire me? I\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my\\njob so I\\'m not sure if this would affect eligibility or anything.  Asking this\\nfor a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to get a\\nmedical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain\\nmedicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%,\\nbecause its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the property.  Can\\nthe park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?\\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons, I just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got\\nback from vacation in Colorado where I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m\\nseeking employment in Kansas. The day i returned I was offered a job through a\\nstaffing company and have a drug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I\\nwill not pass as I smoked regularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well.\\nShould I tell the staffing company or just ghost them? Are there any legal\\nramifications for failing a drug test should I try to do so?    So to start: I’m\\nnot the employee that would be breathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I\\nwork for a small company ~30 people. We are half office/production warehouse.\\nSome of the team has been drinking either during and or before work. Mostly\\noffice employees but some production staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.\\nAnother manager mentioned the owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if\\nstaff were drunk should they appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a\\ndrug test where you need to take them somewhere for that to be administered.\\nIt’s mentioned in our handbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal\\ndrugs during working hours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be\\nrefrained from unless necessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and\\nalcohol are extremely prohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be\\nserved on a case by case basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who\\nattend local mixers often for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so\\ncurious than anything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know,\\nif this did occur if it’s legal or not .  This is in Iowa. My employer recently\\ninitiated a random drug testing program. This is not good news for me as I am an\\noccasional recreational user of marijuana. I began researching my rights as far\\nas the drug testing and came across Iowa Code 730.5. It says that employees have\\nthe right to testing done with \"regard to the privacy of the employee.\"   My\\nquestion is, what does this \"regard to the privacy of the employee\" mean? Are\\nthey allowed to watch me urinate while taking the test? In a previous round of\\ndrug tests they did, my co-worker told me that a police officer and one of the\\nemployees of the company doing the testing were in the bathroom while they were\\ntold to urinate. Is this legal in the state of Iowa?   Any insight appreciated,\\nthanks   EDIT: I just found out that the guy watching was a  \"former\" police\\nofficer who now works at the drug testing place. Not an actual police officer.\\nSorry for confusion.   I recently started working at a small manufacturing\\ncompany in Los Angeles working as an e-commerce specialist. My boss told me that\\nthere would be random drug testing for employees. I’ve been looking up the\\nlegality of random drug tests in California and to my best understanding random\\ndrug tests are only allowed for employees who work more dangerous jobs, and I do\\nnot qualify under that standard. Would a random drug test for me be legal?\\nAlso, if I were to refuse to take the random drug test could I be fired?  I\\nalready asked this question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old\\nMichigan resident and we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December\\n1st. I also have my concealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one\\nof the dispensaries and buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will\\nthey take my CPL and/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My\\ngirlfriend is also 23 but has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the\\ndispensary herself. If I am only BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land\\nme legal punitive repercussions?  If my boss knows I have an underlying mental\\nhealth problem, and I call in sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does,\\ncan I take legal action?  Hey LegalAdvice,  I live in the United States,\\nSpecifically Massachusetts in the greater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student\\nwho works at a large drug store once a week, since I am in school.   I went into\\nwork last weekend and had noticed that my job title, along with my pay\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDecreasing by .75C/HR\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m was changed without me being told about this change.\\nThe reason for the change was supposedly due to the position being given to\\nother members of the store, and that a limited amount of members are given the\\nposition. The thing is, I was never informed of such a change and it was a\\ncomplete surprise to me when I went to check my pay stub and see what had\\nchanged.  Do I have any recourse here,  Or is this completely legal? Quite\\nannoyed with my boss right now as it seems like this is something that is even\\nslightly legal...but I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.\\nIf any other information is needed, I\\'ll be standing by watching this post!\\nThank you guys.   I was displaying signs of extreme anxiety at work. Employer\\ndeemed me to be a threat to the work place/myself. Employer has asked for\\nauthorization to speak with my physician 1:1 to provide assurance that I can be\\ntransitioned back into the workplace.  Am I required to do this to retain my\\njob?  I have worked a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my\\nsupervisor is putting us on alternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a\\ntime-release medication for mental health that does not last 12 hours, and one\\nof the side affects is that I am rendered unable to focus/complete work related\\ntasks after this medication wears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA\\npaperwork to reflect this/have documented confirmation from my physician, I will\\nbe told to use my sick leave for the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are\\nthere any actions I can take regarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I\\napplied to a small private transport company. Part of the interview process\\ninvolves a drug test and my test came positive for amphetamines. I’m prescribed\\nAdderall XR 10mg for my ADHD and gave the company a note from my doctor\\nexplaining my prescription and diagnosis.   The job asked me if it was possible\\nfor me to not take my prescriptions. I said no because it really helps me\\nfunction. Like I’m not incompetent but still. Then, the employer emailed me\\nstating that “due to liability issues associated with your medications, we are\\nunable to hire you.”  I’ve volunteered in 911 EMS for a couple years with no\\nissues while on medications. I got a 96 on my state certification exam. My\\nmedications does have a note warning : “Drug may impair ability to operate a\\nvehicle, vessel, or machine. Use care.” So fair enough- even though my meds have\\nnever made me dizzy or tired in the decade I’ve been taking them. I don’t feel\\nincompetent. But my friends have told me that what the company did was\\ndiscrimination.   I don’t want to file an ADA complaint unless it actually is\\ndiscrimination. Was this discrimination?  Is that legal discrimination?  My\\nemployer recently went through structural changes, and included in the headache\\nof the merger is an email that went out this week detailing our company’s new\\n“wellness program.” In this new program, effective at the end of February, we\\nwill be charged fifty dollars a check for being a smoker. The only way to prove\\nwe don’t smoke is to come in on my day off to have “biometric enrollment” done.\\nNow there are points you can get for things like BMI and blood pressure, but the\\ndiscounts for those aren’t effective until 2019.  I have two questions. One, can\\nmy employer institute this policy after we had already signed open enrollment?\\nTwo, if I have to go in on a day off for this can I clock in? Thanks y’all!\\nmaybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to build an online\\nstore and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of dry herb\\nvaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my question is,\\nhow should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the product. would it\\nbe illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of the product with\\nmarijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most paraphernalia\\nstores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a video presentation\\nfor the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to include mention of\\nmarijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i live in massachusetts\\nwhere marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on moving to colorado but\\nthat would be after the start up of this business. if it is illegal or at least\\nnot smart of me to advertise or sell products related to marijuana out of\\nmassachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing and shipping\\ncomes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  I currently work for a\\nstaffing agency, when I picked up my check today I noticed I had less hours than\\nusual. When I asked my employer why my check was off they stated that the\\nbusiness I contracted with was now requiring them to deduct lunch breaks. I am\\nnot able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being\\nthe only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is\\nthis legal? Everything I\\'ve found online says they cannot deduct a lunch break\\nunless I am free to leave premesis, which I am not. Any information on this\\nissue and advice on course of action would be appreciated  Hello people of\\nLegalAdvice,  I work for a grocery store as a part time worker getting roughly\\n32 hours a week. About a month and a half ago, I got injured while working and\\nhave been on modified duty as of yesterday. I just got cleared and my store\\nmanager and department manager basically told me that I have to compete against\\nthe worker who was filling in for me while I was unable to do my original job. I\\nhave 2 weeks until the decision is made. I won’t be loosing my job, I would be\\ngetting placed in a lesser position which may result in less hours and pay. I’m\\nnot sure if this is legal and I’m not really sire what I should do.

The response should be\\npresented as a list of key points, after creating the title of the content,\\nformatted in Markdown with appropriate markup for clarity and organization.\\n---        Here is any available background question + answer pairs:        ---\\nQuestion 0: What legal challenges are connected to the use of medical marijuana\\nin the workplace? Answer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents\\nseveral legal challenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges\\narise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use\\nand federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some\\nof the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace:  1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal\\nunder federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if\\nan employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state\\nlaw, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act (HIPAA).  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation (DOT). These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL). This means that employers in New\\nYork State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who\\nare certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other\\nemployee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a\\nfederal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate\\nfederal law.  However, even with state-level protections, there are complexities\\ndue to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I\\ncontrolled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are\\nsubject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in\\nindustries regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT). These employers\\nmay be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting\\nmarijuana use.  In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that\\nreceive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may\\nbe additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and\\nregulations.  Regarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the\\nsubsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card,\\nit\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law\\nor safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides\\nsome protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the\\nhospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.  In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act (AMMA) prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.   Question 3: How\\ndoes the legality of medical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?\\nAnswer: The legality of medical marijuana intersects with workplace policies in\\na complex and often challenging way due to the varying laws and regulations at\\nthe federal and state levels, as well as the specific policies of individual\\nemployers.  1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana is classified as a Schedule\\nI controlled substance under federal law, making it illegal at the federal\\nlevel. However, many states have legalized medical marijuana, creating a\\nconflict between state and federal laws. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries\\nregulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), may be required to maintain\\na drug-free workplace, which includes prohibiting marijuana use, regardless of\\nstate laws.  2. **Workplace Policies**: Employers often have their own drug and\\nalcohol policies, which may include zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace\\npolicies. These policies can apply to all employees, including those who do not\\nperform safety-sensitive duties. Employers may argue that such policies are\\nnecessary to maintain safety and productivity, and they may enforce these\\npolicies even in states where medical marijuana is legal.  3. **Safety-Sensitive\\nPositions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for\\npositions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may\\nbe deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for\\nemployees in these roles to ensure safety.  4. **Disability Discrimination and\\nReasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical\\nconditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with\\nDisabilities Act (ADA). However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and\\nsince marijuana is illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required\\nto accommodate medical marijuana use. State laws may offer more protection, but\\nthis varies by state.  5. **Drug Testing**: Employers with drug testing policies\\nmay face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests\\npositive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users,\\nwhich may limit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based\\nsolely on a positive test for marijuana.  6. **Privacy Concerns**: If an\\nemployee discloses their medical marijuana use to an employer, there may be\\nconcerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription\\ndrug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate\\nprivacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\\n(HIPAA), when handling such information.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and\\nUnemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee\\nwho uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment\\nbenefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8.\\n**Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment\\ncontracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions\\nregarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  In\\nsummary, the intersection of the legality of medical marijuana with workplace\\npolicies is highly complex and varies by jurisdiction. Employers and employees\\nmust carefully navigate the patchwork of laws and company policies. Employees\\nwho use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an\\nattorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana\\nregulations in their specific state.   Question 4: What are the legal rights and\\nresponsibilities regarding medical marijuana and employment? Answer: The legal\\nrights and responsibilities regarding medical marijuana and employment are\\ncomplex and vary significantly by state, as well as between state and federal\\nlaws. Here are some general points to consider:  1. **Federal Law**: Marijuana\\nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, making it\\nillegal at the federal level. This means that federal employees and those\\nworking in federally regulated industries, such as transportation, may be\\nprohibited from using marijuana, even if it is for medical purposes.  2. **State\\nProtections**: Many states have enacted laws that provide certain protections\\nfor medical marijuana patients, including protection against employment\\ndiscrimination. However, these protections can vary widely from state to state.\\nSome states may protect medical marijuana users from being fired or refused\\nemployment solely based on their status as a medical marijuana patient, while\\nothers may not offer such protections.  3. **Disability Discrimination**:\\nEmployees with medical conditions that qualify for medical marijuana use may be\\nprotected under state disability laws or the Americans with Disabilities Act\\n(ADA). However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and since marijuana\\nis illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required to accommodate\\nmedical marijuana use in the workplace.  4. **Drug Testing**: Employers may have\\ndrug testing policies in place, and the legality of taking adverse employment\\naction against an employee who tests positive for THC (the active ingredient in\\nmarijuana) can vary by state. Some states have protections for medical marijuana\\nusers, while others may allow employers to enforce a zero-tolerance drug policy.\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace, and for positions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of\\nmedical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of\\nmedical marijuana for employees in these roles to ensure safety.  6. **Employer\\nPolicies**: Employers often have their own drug and alcohol policies, which may\\ninclude zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace policies. These policies can apply\\nto all employees, and employers may enforce these policies even in states where\\nmedical marijuana is legal, particularly if they have federal contracts or are\\nsubject to federal regulations.  7. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees who disclose\\ntheir medical marijuana use to an employer may have concerns about privacy.\\nEmployers must navigate privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability\\nand Accountability Act (HIPAA), when handling such information.  8. **Workers\\'\\nCompensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about\\nwhether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\'\\ncompensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or\\nterminated for marijuana use.  9. **Employment Contracts and Collective\\nBargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining\\nagreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that\\ncould affect medical marijuana users.  10. **Legal Advice**: Given the\\ncomplexities and evolving legal landscape, both employers and employees are\\nadvised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights and\\nobligations in their jurisdiction.  In summary, the rights and responsibilities\\nregarding medical marijuana and employment are determined by a combination of\\nfederal and state laws, employer policies, and the specific circumstances of the\\nemployee\\'s medical condition and job role. Legal advice is often necessary to\\nnavigate these issues, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful\\ntermination issues are involved.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital,\\nand they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I\\nwas offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment\\nphysical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that\\nI am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already\\ncontacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I\\nmay or may not have a case.  Hello,  I was considering getting a medical\\nmarijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and\\nit\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The problem is my company has a\\nzero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated\\ndrivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they\\nhave a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As for the rest of us, even us\\noffice folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that\\neveryone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can\\ndrive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and\\nalcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have\\nlegalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT\\nsay anything about medical cards.  I live in Arizona where medical marijuana is\\nlegal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their\\npolicy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it\\nviolate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a\\nmedical card? What can I do?   I feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish\\nI could do the one thing that helps me.  Thank you.  I have my medical marijuana\\ncard because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s\\njoints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been\\nlooking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and\\nknow its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania\\nand how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke\\nbefore or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the\\nlegality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I\\nhappen to fail the test.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the\\nemployer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first\\ntime on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Asking\\nthis for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to\\nget a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his\\npain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home\\n100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the\\nproperty.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds\\nfor him?    maybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to\\nbuild an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of\\ndry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my\\nquestion is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the\\nproduct. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of\\nthe product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most\\nparaphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a\\nvideo presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to\\ninclude mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i\\nlive in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on\\nmoving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it\\nis illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to\\nmarijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing\\nand shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  I work a\\nfederal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their\\nduties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for\\nanyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use\\nCBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk\\nbut I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I\\njust go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me?\\nI\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure\\nif this would affect eligibility or anything.  Throwaway account for obvious\\nreasons, I just graduated (BS biology) and got back from vacation in Colorado\\nwhere I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas.\\nThe day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a\\ndrug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked\\nregularly (daily) prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing\\ncompany or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug\\ntest should I try to do so?    So to start: I’m not the employee that would be\\nbreathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30\\npeople. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been\\ndrinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some\\nproduction staff (they work around heavy machinery). Another manager mentioned\\nthe owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should\\nthey appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need\\nto take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s mentioned in our\\nhandbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working\\nhours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless\\nnecessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely\\nprohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by\\ncase basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers\\noften for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so curious than\\nanything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did\\noccur if it’s legal or not .  Hello!  &amp;amp;#x200B;  I could write a novel on\\nthis, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to\\nbest get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is\\nneeded on anything!  \\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10\\nmonths. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned\\nto work.  \\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill\\nto an underlying medical condition (I have a hunch that the injury set it off,\\nbut idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed). I pushed through\\na lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent\\nhome from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my\\nhours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They\\nagreed.  \\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as\\ncommunicative as possible about it.   \\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours\\nhave begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents\\nfrom a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to\\nstart back full time immediately.   \\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it\\nconflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about\\nit. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts,\\nthat I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their\\nhand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get\\nthem the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted\\nto ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very\\nhesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I\\nrealized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details\\nabout where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.  \\\\-2 days later,\\nHR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying\\nto set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them\\nuntil 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of\\ndue to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my\\ncondition online (cause bills).  \\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused.\\nThey used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off\\nwork as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before,\\nand I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I\\nfelt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they\\nwanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one\\npoint, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying\\nis, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right.\\nThey then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to\\ngo back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now (even though\\nthat makes me terribly uncomfortable now). I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten\\nsick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s\\ndefinitely not that simple.  &amp;amp;#x200B;  My question is:...do you think my\\ncompany is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick\\nemployee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate\\nthis feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with.\\nAll I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off.\\nAnd if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a\\nnormal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?  I already asked\\nthis question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident\\nand we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my\\nconcealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries\\nand buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL\\nand/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23\\nbut has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am\\nonly BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive\\nrepercussions?  MICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, (let’s call him\\nJim) shared my text with my boss (Bob). I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00\\npm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night\\nwhich I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me\\nup. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted “Can you get me in\\na few” “You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the\\nexit gate cuz I locked the other one” “Damn I thought I was sending that to my\\nride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a\\nride. My boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager\\nhad a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I\\nwas apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I\\nunderstood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed\\nafter park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the\\npark after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came\\nthrough to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to\\ncity hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be\\nimportant to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking\\ninto FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC\\nRECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid (7 years ago) in the same city which\\nholds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came\\nback from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his\\ntrust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to\\ninvite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I\\nnever had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but\\nclaimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere\\nso I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not.  He also told\\nme that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been\\nperforming “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when\\nI dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will\\nneed surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things\\nquestioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I\\nalready didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through\\nissues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my\\nshoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going\\nthrough any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises\\nquestions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I\\nLIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from\\nmy family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t\\nunderstand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I\\nhave never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for “conduct\\ndetrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal\\nin Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s\\nparking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my\\nbosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city\\nmanager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file(dismissed under HYTA the Holmes\\nyouth trainee act) with my boss when considering my termination.  Hey\\nLegalAdvice,  I live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the\\ngreater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store\\nonce a week, since I am in school.   I went into work last weekend and had\\nnoticed that my job title, along with my pay (Decreasing by .75C/HR) was changed\\nwithout me being told about this change.   The reason for the change was\\nsupposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and\\nthat a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was\\nnever informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went\\nto check my pay stub and see what had changed.  Do I have any recourse here,  Or\\nis this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like\\nthis is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what\\nyou guys have to say about this.   If any other information is needed, I\\'ll be\\nstanding by watching this post!   Thank you guys.   Maryland, USA First question\\nhere, basically title. What do I need to know before I (a highschool student and\\nminor) attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough\\nmovement organized by the Women\\'s March Group?  In particular I have these\\nquestions:  -Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently\\nthan participators?   -How are organizers/participators usually punished?  Thank\\nyou!   If my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call\\nin sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I\\ndon’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a\\nr/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp;amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m\\nnot looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more\\nso for future reference.  I’ve done a bit of googling &amp;amp; can’t come up with\\nanything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also\\nfeel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp;amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3\\njobs total, 1 for 2 &amp;amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp;amp; another for like 2-3\\nmonths.  Awhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp;amp; had to request a\\nday off (some months out) for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor\\nwas the one that scheduling was dealt with through.  I request the day off &amp;amp;\\ntell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment.  She asks me\\n“what kind of doctor?”  I was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type\\nof doctor I was going to be seeing.  She then says “I need to know what for.”  I\\nfeel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I\\nexplained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp;amp; she seemed\\nsatisfied enough. I got the day off.  Basically I’m just curious if this is\\ncommon practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s\\nnot? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp;amp; might be overthinking it\\naltogether.  (Obligatory apology for mobile formatting)  Hey there Legal advice.\\nThis here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My\\nquestion is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells\\nsmoking paraphernalia  (pipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...)\\nand maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-\\ndown area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find\\nany shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County (the two\\npotential areas I would consider operating). The closest store I have seen to\\nthis was in Toronto(clearly not NYC or Nassau County LI).  I have worked a 9-5\\nMon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on\\nalternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for\\nmental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I\\nam rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication\\nwears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I’m sure the reason I can’t find the\\nanswer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of\\nthem, though one more than the other.   When it comes to things like FMLA and\\nthe other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include\\nboth clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?  Clinic A has 14 employees,\\nclinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time (Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday)\\nin clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\nThank you in advance.  Hello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but\\nonly just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a\\nbit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just\\ndue to concerns.  Just as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a\\nrelatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering\\nthe phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in\\ncivil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the\\nbasement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I\\nperformed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to\\nthe department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a\\nbackup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent\\nreviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I\\nstarted to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before;\\nsecondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a\\nlittle unhealthy.  I should preface this by saying I have several mental health\\nissues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel\\ncomfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble\\nwith memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and\\nwhile I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two\\ndays. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my\\nprevious position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are\\nbeing counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a\\nyear at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal\\nadmonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were\\napparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the\\nsame building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take\\nback my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to\\naffirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my\\nsupervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either\\ndepartment, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told\\nme that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and\\nthat they may have done this in the past.  To try and shorten this all: despite\\nmy having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are\\nspreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions.\\nI fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and\\ncontact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and\\nfire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have\\ntrouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate\\nadvice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.  I work for\\na small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to\\ncreate a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the\\nlegality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the\\nposition to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the\\nposition  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them\\nfirst, but they would not be best for the company.

Answer: The use of medical marijuana in the workplace presents\\nseveral legal challenges, both for employees and employers. These challenges\\narise from the conflict between state laws that may permit medical marijuana use\\nand federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance. Here are some\\nof the key legal issues connected to the use of medical marijuana in the\\nworkplace:  1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains illegal\\nunder federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that even if\\nan employee is legally prescribed marijuana for medical purposes under state\\nlaw, they are still violating federal law. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, especially those with federal contracts or those in industries like\\ntransportation that are regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may\\nbe required to enforce a drug-free workplace policy that prohibits marijuana\\nuse.  2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees who use medical marijuana may\\nhave underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. While the ADA does\\nnot protect illegal drug use, employees may argue that adverse actions taken\\nagainst them because of their medical marijuana use are actually based on their\\nunderlying disability, which could lead to claims of discrimination.  3.\\n**Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are generally required to provide\\nreasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. However, courts have\\nbeen divided on whether allowing the use of medical marijuana is a reasonable\\naccommodation, especially since it is illegal under federal law.  4. **Drug\\nTesting Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies may face challenges\\nwhen an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive for THC. The\\nlegality of taking adverse employment action against such an employee can vary\\nby state, and some states have protections for medical marijuana users.  5.\\n**Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace. For positions that are safety-sensitive, employers may argue that the\\nuse of medical marijuana poses a risk to safety and, therefore, must be\\nprohibited regardless of an employee\\'s medical marijuana patient status.  6.\\n**Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues,\\nespecially if an employer discloses an employee\\'s medical condition or\\nprescription drug use to others in the workplace. There may also be concerns\\nabout whether such disclosures violate the Health Insurance Portability and\\nAccountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with\\nzero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not modify\\ntheir policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana users.\\nEmployers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights of\\nemployees under state law.  8. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  9. **Housing\\nand Land Use**: For employees who live in employer-provided housing or in\\ncertain communities, there may be rules or lease agreements that prohibit the\\nuse of marijuana on the property, which can affect the employee\\'s ability to use\\nmedical marijuana.  10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining\\nAgreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may\\nhave specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that could affect\\nmedical marijuana users.  In summary, the legal landscape surrounding medical\\nmarijuana use in the workplace is complex and varies significantly by state.\\nEmployers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal\\nprohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations.\\nLegal advice is often necessary to address specific situations, especially when\\npotential discrimination or wrongful termination issues are involved.   Question\\n1: What impact does medical marijuana use have on employment laws? Answer: The\\nimpact of medical marijuana use on employment laws is multifaceted and varies\\nsignificantly by state, as well as between state and federal laws. Here are some\\nof the key impacts and considerations:  1. **State vs. Federal Law**: While many\\nstates have legalized medical marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law as\\na Schedule I controlled substance. This creates a conflict for employers who\\nmust comply with federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or\\nthose in industries like transportation that are regulated by the Department of\\nTransportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers may be required to maintain a drug-free\\nworkplace, which can include prohibiting marijuana use.  2. **Disability\\nDiscrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical\\nmarijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities\\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m or similar state laws. Employers\\nare generally required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with\\ndisabilities, but courts have been divided on whether allowing the use of\\nmedical marijuana is a reasonable accommodation, given its federal illegality.\\n3. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face\\nchallenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests positive\\nfor THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users, which may\\nlimit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based solely on a\\npositive test for marijuana.  4. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have\\na duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for positions that are safety-\\nsensitive, the use of medical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers\\nmay prohibit the use of medical marijuana for employees in these roles, even if\\nthey are legal medical marijuana patients.  5. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees\\nwho disclose their medical marijuana use may have concerns about privacy,\\nespecially if their medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed to\\nothers in the workplace. Employers must navigate privacy laws, such as the\\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such\\ninformation.  6. **Zero Tolerance and Drug-Free Workplace Policies**: Employers\\nwith zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not\\nmodify their policies to account for state laws that protect medical marijuana\\nusers. Employers must balance their drug-free workplace policies with the rights\\nof employees under state law.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and Unemployment\\nBenefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee who uses\\nmedical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment benefits\\nif they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8. **Employment\\nContracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or\\ncollective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use\\nand testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  9. **Employer\\nAccommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and potentially revise\\ntheir accommodation policies to address the use of medical marijuana, especially\\nin states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.  10. **Legal\\nUncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical\\nmarijuana use leads to uncertainty for both employers and employees. This can\\nresult in litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations\\nunder the law.  In summary, the impact of medical marijuana use on employment\\nlaws is complex and requires employers to carefully navigate a patchwork of\\nstate protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law. Employers and\\nemployees are advised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights\\nand obligations in their jurisdiction.   Question 2: Are there any specific\\nregulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment? Answer: Yes, there\\nare specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use and employment, and\\nthese regulations can vary significantly from state to state. In the context of\\nNew York State, where you mentioned you are a medical marijuana patient, the\\nCompassionate Care Act provides some protections for medical marijuana patients.\\nUnder this act, certified patients are considered to have a \"disability\" under\\nthe New York State Human Rights Law \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mNYSHRL\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. This means that employers in New\\nYork State are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who\\nare certified to use medical marijuana, just as they would for any other\\nemployee with a disability, unless doing so would cause the employer to lose a\\nfederal contract or funding, or if it would cause the employer to violate\\nfederal law.  However, even with state-level protections, there are complexities\\ndue to the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I\\ncontrolled substance. This federal illegality can affect employers who are\\nsubject to federal regulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in\\nindustries regulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. These employers\\nmay be required to maintain a drug-free workplace, which can include prohibiting\\nmarijuana use.  In the healthcare industry, particularly in hospitals that\\nreceive federal funding through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, there may\\nbe additional complexities due to the need to comply with federal laws and\\nregulations.  Regarding your situation with the pre-employment physical and the\\nsubsequent refusal to hire you after presenting your medical marijuana card,\\nit\\'s possible that the hospital is concerned about compliance with federal law\\nor safety-sensitive positions. However, given that New York State law provides\\nsome protections, it\\'s advisable to seek legal counsel to determine if the\\nhospital\\'s actions constitute discrimination under state law.  In other states,\\nsuch as Pennsylvania and Arizona, which you mentioned, the legal landscape may\\nbe different. Some states have explicit protections for medical marijuana\\npatients, while others do not. In Arizona, for example, the Arizona Medical\\nMarijuana Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mAMMA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prohibits most employers from discriminating against\\nregistered qualifying patients solely for testing positive for marijuana\\ncomponents or metabolites.  As for the federal jobs and positions that are not\\ntypically tested but may be subject to random testing, the use of CBD/hemp\\nproducts that are legal at the state level but not federally can still pose a\\nrisk if a drug test is administered and returns a positive result for THC.  In\\nsummary, while there are specific regulations concerning medical marijuana use\\nand employment, they are complex and vary by state, and they must be balanced\\nwith federal law. Employees who use medical marijuana and face employment issues\\nshould consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws\\nand medical marijuana regulations in their specific state.   Question 3: How\\ndoes the legality of medical marijuana intersect with workplace policies?\\nAnswer: The legality of medical marijuana intersects with workplace policies in\\na complex and often challenging way due to the varying laws and regulations at\\nthe federal and state levels, as well as the specific policies of individual\\nemployers.  1. **Federal vs. State Law**: Marijuana is classified as a Schedule\\nI controlled substance under federal law, making it illegal at the federal\\nlevel. However, many states have legalized medical marijuana, creating a\\nconflict between state and federal laws. Employers who are subject to federal\\nregulations, such as those with federal contracts or those in industries\\nregulated by the Department of Transportation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDOT\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, may be required to maintain\\na drug-free workplace, which includes prohibiting marijuana use, regardless of\\nstate laws.  2. **Workplace Policies**: Employers often have their own drug and\\nalcohol policies, which may include zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace\\npolicies. These policies can apply to all employees, including those who do not\\nperform safety-sensitive duties. Employers may argue that such policies are\\nnecessary to maintain safety and productivity, and they may enforce these\\npolicies even in states where medical marijuana is legal.  3. **Safety-Sensitive\\nPositions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, and for\\npositions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of medical marijuana may\\nbe deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of medical marijuana for\\nemployees in these roles to ensure safety.  4. **Disability Discrimination and\\nReasonable Accommodation**: Employees who use medical marijuana for medical\\nconditions may be protected under state disability laws or the Americans with\\nDisabilities Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and\\nsince marijuana is illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required\\nto accommodate medical marijuana use. State laws may offer more protection, but\\nthis varies by state.  5. **Drug Testing**: Employers with drug testing policies\\nmay face challenges when an employee who is a medical marijuana patient tests\\npositive for THC. Some states have protections for medical marijuana users,\\nwhich may limit an employer\\'s ability to take adverse employment action based\\nsolely on a positive test for marijuana.  6. **Privacy Concerns**: If an\\nemployee discloses their medical marijuana use to an employer, there may be\\nconcerns about privacy, especially if their medical condition or prescription\\ndrug use is disclosed to others in the workplace. Employers must navigate\\nprivacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such information.  7. **Workers\\' Compensation and\\nUnemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about whether an employee\\nwho uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\' compensation or unemployment\\nbenefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.  8.\\n**Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Some employment\\ncontracts or collective bargaining agreements may have specific provisions\\nregarding drug use and testing that could affect medical marijuana users.  In\\nsummary, the intersection of the legality of medical marijuana with workplace\\npolicies is highly complex and varies by jurisdiction. Employers and employees\\nmust carefully navigate the patchwork of laws and company policies. Employees\\nwho use medical marijuana and face employment issues should consult with an\\nattorney who is knowledgeable about the employment laws and medical marijuana\\nregulations in their specific state.   Question 4: What are the legal rights and\\nresponsibilities regarding medical marijuana and employment? Answer: The legal\\nrights and responsibilities regarding medical marijuana and employment are\\ncomplex and vary significantly by state, as well as between state and federal\\nlaws. Here are some general points to consider:  1. **Federal Law**: Marijuana\\nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, making it\\nillegal at the federal level. This means that federal employees and those\\nworking in federally regulated industries, such as transportation, may be\\nprohibited from using marijuana, even if it is for medical purposes.  2. **State\\nProtections**: Many states have enacted laws that provide certain protections\\nfor medical marijuana patients, including protection against employment\\ndiscrimination. However, these protections can vary widely from state to state.\\nSome states may protect medical marijuana users from being fired or refused\\nemployment solely based on their status as a medical marijuana patient, while\\nothers may not offer such protections.  3. **Disability Discrimination**:\\nEmployees with medical conditions that qualify for medical marijuana use may be\\nprotected under state disability laws or the Americans with Disabilities Act\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mADA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. However, the ADA does not protect illegal drug use, and since marijuana\\nis illegal at the federal level, employers may not be required to accommodate\\nmedical marijuana use in the workplace.  4. **Drug Testing**: Employers may have\\ndrug testing policies in place, and the legality of taking adverse employment\\naction against an employee who tests positive for THC \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthe active ingredient in\\nmarijuana\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m can vary by state. Some states have protections for medical marijuana\\nusers, while others may allow employers to enforce a zero-tolerance drug policy.\\n5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe\\nworkplace, and for positions that are considered safety-sensitive, the use of\\nmedical marijuana may be deemed incompatible. Employers may prohibit the use of\\nmedical marijuana for employees in these roles to ensure safety.  6. **Employer\\nPolicies**: Employers often have their own drug and alcohol policies, which may\\ninclude zero-tolerance or drug-free workplace policies. These policies can apply\\nto all employees, and employers may enforce these policies even in states where\\nmedical marijuana is legal, particularly if they have federal contracts or are\\nsubject to federal regulations.  7. **Privacy Concerns**: Employees who disclose\\ntheir medical marijuana use to an employer may have concerns about privacy.\\nEmployers must navigate privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability\\nand Accountability Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mHIPAA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m, when handling such information.  8. **Workers\\'\\nCompensation and Unemployment Benefits**: There may be legal questions about\\nwhether an employee who uses medical marijuana is eligible for workers\\'\\ncompensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or\\nterminated for marijuana use.  9. **Employment Contracts and Collective\\nBargaining Agreements**: Some employment contracts or collective bargaining\\nagreements may have specific provisions regarding drug use and testing that\\ncould affect medical marijuana users.  10. **Legal Advice**: Given the\\ncomplexities and evolving legal landscape, both employers and employees are\\nadvised to seek legal counsel to understand their specific rights and\\nobligations in their jurisdiction.  In summary, the rights and responsibilities\\nregarding medical marijuana and employment are determined by a combination of\\nfederal and state laws, employer policies, and the specific circumstances of the\\nemployee\\'s medical condition and job role. Legal advice is often necessary to\\nnavigate these issues, especially when potential discrimination or wrongful\\ntermination issues are involved.    ---        Here is additional context\\nrelevant to the question:        ---   I\\'m a New York State medical marijuana\\npatient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital,\\nand they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I\\nwas offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment\\nphysical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that\\nI am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already\\ncontacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I\\nmay or may not have a case.  Hello,  I was considering getting a medical\\nmarijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and\\nit\\'s one of the few things that really help.  The problem is my company has a\\nzero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated\\ndrivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they\\nhave a medical card, this makes sense to me.  As for the rest of us, even us\\noffice folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that\\neveryone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can\\ndrive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and\\nalcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have\\nlegalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT\\nsay anything about medical cards.  I live in Arizona where medical marijuana is\\nlegal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their\\npolicy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it\\nviolate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a\\nmedical card? What can I do?   I feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish\\nI could do the one thing that helps me.  Thank you.  I have my medical marijuana\\ncard because mj lets me eat, not feel like my body is coming apart at it\\'s\\njoints, feel like life is not so hopeless, and sleep soundly, but I\\'ve been\\nlooking for new jobs and I\\'m unsure about drug testing.   I\\'ve looked it up and\\nknow its a state-to-state thing, but I\\'m still a little iffy about Pennsylvania\\nand how weirdly 50/50 it seems to be with medical marijuana. I don\\'t smoke\\nbefore or during work and never intend to do so. However I\\'m unsure about the\\nlegality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I\\nhappen to fail the test.   Will I get fired or fined from work and would the\\nemployer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?  Also, this is my first\\ntime on this sub so I hope this isn\\'t an annoying question or something.  Asking\\nthis for a friend who lives in a mobile home park in California.  He wants to\\nget a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his\\npain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home\\n100%, because its on the park\\'s land he can\\'t use it or bring it on the\\nproperty.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds\\nfor him?    maybe wrong flair but whatever. any help appreciated  trying to\\nbuild an online store and start a crowd funding page as im working on a line of\\ndry herb vaporizers that i will be putting up for sale on the website. so my\\nquestion is, how should i approach the advertisement and mentioning of the\\nproduct. would it be illegal or again guidelines to openly talk about the use of\\nthe product with marijuana, and should i be bluffing with the same story most\\nparaphernalia stores say, \"for tobacco use only\". and if i were to create a\\nvideo presentation for the crowd funding page would it be counter productive to\\ninclude mention of marijuana and the community/culture built around it.  ps i\\nlive in massachusetts where marijuana is still a touchy subject. i intend on\\nmoving to colorado but that would be after the start up of this business. if it\\nis illegal or at least not smart of me to advertise or sell products related to\\nmarijuana out of massachusetts. would matters be different if the manufacturing\\nand shipping comes out of a place where it is legal. i.e. colorado  I work a\\nfederal job. Certain positions at my work get drug tested because of their\\nduties. To my knowledge, my position does not get tested. It\\'s possible for\\nanyone to get tested but it looks like they just don\\'t test mine. I use\\nCBD/hemp, which is legal in my state but not federally. I know I\\'m taking a risk\\nbut I use it for health reasons. If I do get selected to get tested, should I\\njust go ahead and take the test and fired? Or do I quit before they can fire me?\\nI\\'d have to sign up for Obamacare insurance if I did lose my job so I\\'m not sure\\nif this would affect eligibility or anything.  Throwaway account for obvious\\nreasons, I just graduated \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBS biology\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and got back from vacation in Colorado\\nwhere I smoked weed. I live in Missouri and I\\'m seeking employment in Kansas.\\nThe day i returned I was offered a job through a staffing company and have a\\ndrug screening on the 15th, I am almost certain I will not pass as I smoked\\nregularly \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdaily\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m prior to this vacation as well. Should I tell the staffing\\ncompany or just ghost them? Are there any legal ramifications for failing a drug\\ntest should I try to do so?    So to start: I’m not the employee that would be\\nbreathalyzed if it’s legal but I’m curious.   I work for a small company ~30\\npeople. We are half office/production warehouse. Some of the team has been\\ndrinking either during and or before work. Mostly office employees but some\\nproduction staff \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthey work around heavy machinery\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. Another manager mentioned\\nthe owner potentially getting a breathalyzer to see if staff were drunk should\\nthey appear so.. is that legal? Or is it similar to a drug test where you need\\nto take them somewhere for that to be administered.   It’s mentioned in our\\nhandbook in excess about not drinking or doing illegal drugs during working\\nhours. It notes that while marijuana is legal it should be refrained from unless\\nnecessary and prescribed by a doctor but all drugs and alcohol are extremely\\nprohibited, except for work functions where alcohol may be served on a case by\\ncase basis. Which I’m sure refers to more office staff who attend local mixers\\noften for lunch or during the day then return,   I’m more so curious than\\nanything - I don’t drink during or at work but would like to know, if this did\\noccur if it’s legal or not .  Hello!  &amp;#x200B;  I could write a novel on\\nthis, but I will try to keeps things as concise and clear as possible, so as to\\nbest get my questions answered. Please free free to ask if more information is\\nneeded on anything!  \\\\- I have been an assistant manager at a retail job for 10\\nmonths. While it has its quirks, I generally enjoy it and I do a good job there.\\n\\\\-I had an injury to my eye this January and was out for 1.5 weeks but returned\\nto work.  \\\\-For the three months following that, I slowly fell increasingly ill\\nto an underlying medical condition \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mI have a hunch that the injury set it off,\\nbut idk, and I am still in the fun process of being diagnosed\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I pushed through\\na lot of the undesirable symptoms, but after too many ER visits and getting sent\\nhome from work constantly for illness, I approached my manager about making my\\nhours temporarily part time until I could fulfill full time hours again. They\\nagreed.  \\\\-During this time, I supplied doctors notes, etc. and tried to be as\\ncommunicative as possible about it.   \\\\- About two weeks after my shorter hours\\nhave begun, I am told by my manager on a Wednesday that I need to have documents\\nfrom a doctor stating my medical needs by that Saturday, or I would have to\\nstart back full time immediately.   \\\\- I find a last minute appointment, but it\\nconflicts with my Friday shift, so I get in communication with my manager about\\nit. They blow up on me, say I shouldn\\'t come in for any of my scheduled shifts,\\nthat I deserve to be fired, and that they better have the paperwork in their\\nhand first thing in the morning. I am totally dazed by this outburst, but get\\nthem the paperwork that day and am told that they should have more info Monday.\\n\\\\- I waited 1.5 weeks, but I hadn\\'t heard from anyone until my co-worker texted\\nto ask why I wasn\\'t coming in for my \"scheduled shifts\". Although I was very\\nhesitant about reaching out to my boss due to our last correspondence, I\\nrealized that I needed clarification and sent them an email asking for details\\nabout where I stand with the company. I didn\\'t receive a reply.  \\\\-2 days later,\\nHR sent me an email saying they would like to chat on the phone. I reply trying\\nto set up a time, but dont actually get to have a phone conversation with them\\nuntil 3 weeks later. During these three weeks, I assumed I had been let go of\\ndue to their lack of communication and began to look for jobs suitable for my\\ncondition online \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcause bills\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  \\\\-Today I spoke with HR. I\\'m pretty confused.\\nThey used a lot of technical jargon. They referred to the month I\\'ve been off\\nwork as my \"leave\" but no one had ever mentioned a medical leave to me before,\\nand I let her know that I didn\\'t request to take time off, just shorter hours. I\\nfelt like the way they spoke to me was designed to get the answers they\\nwanted...its a weird thing to feel, but that\\'s the best way to put it. At one\\npoint, they took something I said and twisted it into \"So, what you\\'re saying\\nis, you\\'re resigning?\"....I answered no to this because it didn\\'t feel right.\\nThey then said I had to immediately fill out FMLA forms and that I may have to\\ngo back to work under my old manager as soon as 4 days from now \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32meven though\\nthat makes me terribly uncomfortable now\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I loved my job and if I hadn\\'t gotten\\nsick I would still work there, so I don\\'t want my record to say I quit, as it\\'s\\ndefinitely not that simple.  &amp;#x200B;  My question is:...do you think my\\ncompany is trying to get me to quit so they don\\'t have to deal with a sick\\nemployee and all the accommodations/laws that surround it? I absolutely hate\\nthis feeling, but this has all snowballed to a level that I am unfamiliar with.\\nAll I know is that I feel like something about the situation is really....off.\\nAnd if they are doing something sketchy, is it even worth pursuing? Is this a\\nnormal way for a company to act? or....ugh, idk haha. Help?  I already asked\\nthis question but I feel I need to clarify. I\\'m a 23 year old Michigan resident\\nand we have legalized recreational marijuana as of December 1st. I also have my\\nconcealed pistol license. Am I legally allowed to go to one of the dispensaries\\nand buy recreational marijuana and still retain my CPL? Will they take my CPL\\nand/or firearm away? I DO NOT INTEND ON USING THE POT. My girlfriend is also 23\\nbut has bad anxiety and does not want to go into the dispensary herself. If I am\\nonly BUYING and TRANSPORTING, will that still land me legal punitive\\nrepercussions?  MICHIGAN: I was fired today, after my coworker, \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mlet’s call him\\nJim\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m shared my text with my boss \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mBob\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. I’m a janitor for  a City park. At 11:00\\npm Saturday I was working all alone in the park during my shift Saturday night\\nwhich I have normally done for months, when I went to text my friend to pick me\\nup. Except I sent it to Jim by mistake. This is what I texted “Can you get me in\\na few” “You should bring some weed there’s no one else here lol. Come in the\\nexit gate cuz I locked the other one” “Damn I thought I was sending that to my\\nride🤭😬” At the end of my shift I ended up walking home, because I couldn’t get a\\nride. My boss who is the director of the park, and the assistant city manager\\nhad a meeting this morning.Bob had stressed the fact that I lost his trust, I\\nwas apologetic and accountable for my actions of sending the text and I\\nunderstood I will need to rebuild his trust. And he said I was smoking weed\\nafter park hours with my friend. He thinks I had been having friends over the\\npark after hours “partying”. I never did such a thing, my friend never came\\nthrough to pick me up and he said he would review video footage. He drove to\\ncity hall after the first meeting with the assistant city manager. It may be\\nimportant to know that the assistant city manager is the director of looking\\ninto FOIA requests, in this city I have a sealed and expunged “NON-PUBLIC\\nRECORD” of some dumb shit I did as a kid \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m7 years ago\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in the same city which\\nholds the record. The file was dismissed as I took a HYTA plea. When he came\\nback from city hall he said the city manager and him agreed that i had lost his\\ntrust to perform my functions alone at night because I was basically trying to\\ninvite a friend to come pick me up from work and to “bring weed, and party”, I\\nnever had a friend come in the park after hours. They reviewed the video but\\nclaimed they couldn’t tell if a car adrove in or not. There’s cameras everywhere\\nso I don’t know how they couldn’t tell if a car drove in or not.  He also told\\nme that he would be able to give me a slap on the wrist if I hadn’t been\\nperforming “iffy” the last two weeks, like not coming in one day last week when\\nI dislocated my shoulder, tearing cartilage, and getting an MRI which I will\\nneed surgery for. I gave him a doctors note and everything. He also said things\\nquestioning my character by saying or asking things liked, “before the text, I\\nalready didn’t know anything about you, who you are, if you’re going through\\nissues or not”, I told him at that moment I did have a traumatic injury to my\\nshoulder which I told you about last week, but other than that no I’m not going\\nthrough any issues“ “why don’t you ever drive to work? That alone raises\\nquestions, because I’ve never had an employee of your age not drive to work.” I\\nLIVE a 10 minute walk away from work, so I’m not going to take the car away from\\nmy family all day when they actually need a car to go places. And I don’t\\nunderstand how driving to work takes my character into question. My boss, and I\\nhave never had any issues before. In the end I was terminated for “conduct\\ndetrimental to work”.   I would appreciate advice on this, because weed is legal\\nin Michigan, I NEVER KNEW THAT I CANT GET PICKED UP AFTER WORK IN THE PARK’s\\nparking lot, and I did not break any rules in the workplace other than losing my\\nbosses trust, and more specifically whether it is legal for the assistant city\\nmanager to share my expunged NON-PUBLIC file\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mdismissed under HYTA the Holmes\\nyouth trainee act\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with my boss when considering my termination.  Hey\\nLegalAdvice,  I live in the United States, Specifically Massachusetts in the\\ngreater Boston area. I\\'m a full time student who works at a large drug store\\nonce a week, since I am in school.   I went into work last weekend and had\\nnoticed that my job title, along with my pay \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mDecreasing by .75C/HR\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m was changed\\nwithout me being told about this change.   The reason for the change was\\nsupposedly due to the position being given to other members of the store, and\\nthat a limited amount of members are given the position. The thing is, I was\\nnever informed of such a change and it was a complete surprise to me when I went\\nto check my pay stub and see what had changed.  Do I have any recourse here,  Or\\nis this completely legal? Quite annoyed with my boss right now as it seems like\\nthis is something that is even slightly legal...but I would love to hear what\\nyou guys have to say about this.   If any other information is needed, I\\'ll be\\nstanding by watching this post!   Thank you guys.   Maryland, USA First question\\nhere, basically title. What do I need to know before I \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32ma highschool student and\\nminor\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m attempt to organize a walk out on March 14th as part of the #Enough\\nmovement organized by the Women\\'s March Group?  In particular I have these\\nquestions:  -Are the organizers of these types of events punished differently\\nthan participators?   -How are organizers/participators usually punished?  Thank\\nyou!   If my boss knows I have an underlying mental health problem, and I call\\nin sick, can he fire me for it? If not, and he does, can I take legal action?  I\\ndon’t even know if I’m using the right sub for this, let me know if I’m a\\nr/lostredditor. I’ll keep this short &amp; sweet. I want to make it known I’m\\nnot looking to file a suit or claim or whatever of any sort, this is just more\\nso for future reference.  I’ve done a bit of googling &amp; can’t come up with\\nanything on my own nor do I know if any boundaries were even crossed. I also\\nfeel it’s important to note I’m 20 &amp; have little job experience. I’ve held 3\\njobs total, 1 for 2 &amp; a half years, 1 for 1 year &amp; another for like 2-3\\nmonths.  Awhile ago I was employed at a healthcare agency &amp; had to request a\\nday off \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32msome months out\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m for a doctors appointment. The supervisor of my floor\\nwas the one that scheduling was dealt with through.  I request the day off &amp;\\ntell her it’s a medical need, specifically a doctors appointment.  She asks me\\n“what kind of doctor?”  I was mildly uncomfortable but responded with what type\\nof doctor I was going to be seeing.  She then says “I need to know what for.”  I\\nfeel off even finishing this because it was just plainly uncomfortable but I\\nexplained the specifics of what the appointment was for &amp; she seemed\\nsatisfied enough. I got the day off.  Basically I’m just curious if this is\\ncommon practice amongst employers? I feel like I’m sensible enough to know it’s\\nnot? but I can also be sensitive at times &amp; might be overthinking it\\naltogether.  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mObligatory apology for mobile formatting\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m  Hey there Legal advice.\\nThis here post is not nearly as juicy as some of the other ones on this sub. My\\nquestion is business law related. Is it legal to open up a store that sells\\nsmoking paraphernalia  \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mpipes, water pipes, papers \"tobacco-grinders\" etc...\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nand maybe some t-shirts while also maintaining a small coffee counter and sit-\\ndown area for customers to order some coffee and cookies? I cant seem to find\\nany shop similar to this in either NYC limits or Nassau County \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mthe two\\npotential areas I would consider operating\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m. The closest store I have seen to\\nthis was in Toronto\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mclearly not NYC or Nassau County LI\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.  I have worked a 9-5\\nMon-Fri schedule for 6 years. Due to COVID, my supervisor is putting us on\\nalternating 12-hour shifts. I have recently begun a time-release medication for\\nmental health that does not last 12 hours, and one of the side affects is that I\\nam rendered unable to focus/complete work related tasks after this medication\\nwears off. I was told that if I fill out FMLA paperwork to reflect this/have\\ndocumented confirmation from my physician, I will be told to use my sick leave\\nfor the hours I can’t work. Is this legal? Are there any actions I can take\\nregarding this?  I live in South Carolina.  I’m sure the reason I can’t find the\\nanswer to this is that I’m not describing it well enough but here goes anyway:\\nI work for a small medical clinic that has two locations. I work at both of\\nthem, though one more than the other.   When it comes to things like FMLA and\\nthe other laws that depend on how many employees there are, does that include\\nboth clinics? And if not, which would I fall under?  Clinic A has 14 employees,\\nclinic B has 6. I spend the majority of my time \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mTuesday Wednesday and Thursday\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nin clinic B, working Monday Friday and half days on Saturdays at clinic A.\\nThank you in advance.  Hello all! I\\'ve lurked around on Reddit for a while, but\\nonly just made an account, mostly for this. I apologize in advance if it gets a\\nbit long, with that in mind. I have to keep things as vague as possible, just\\ndue to concerns.  Just as a bit of backstory: I work in a state government, in a\\nrelatively lower-tier position--think scanning, clocking things in, answering\\nthe phone--but some of the things I take care of impact the lives of people in\\ncivil situations. I moved to this position after working a couple years in the\\nbasement--this position was literally a scanning position, nothing more--where I\\nperformed rather well. I was doing well enough that they had me come upstairs to\\nthe department I\\'m in now, in order to help with some quality checking and be a\\nbackup in case the previous worker was out of the office. I got rather decent\\nreviews when that season came, as well. Once I moved to my current position, I\\nstarted to notice some things: firstly, I don\\'t get paid any more than before;\\nsecondly, I have a *lot* more to do than before; and thirdly...the place seems a\\nlittle unhealthy.  I should preface this by saying I have several mental health\\nissues, such as major depression, anxiety, and a couple others I don\\'t feel\\ncomfortable mentioning. I have my papers in order stating that I have trouble\\nwith memory and concentration, and there is a decent amount of fatigue; and\\nwhile I\\'m allowed up to two days a week, I haven\\'t touched it aside from two\\ndays. I try my best to be accurate and efficient, same as when I worked in my\\nprevious position; however, I\\'ve noticed that the small mistakes I make are\\nbeing counted more heavily against me. Despite my having worked barely half a\\nyear at the time, they had begun compiling these wrongs into a formal\\nadmonishment, come early this year. What I did not realize is that they were\\napparently speaking about me to not only my previous employer, who is in the\\nsame building, but to HR, as well. My previous employer, upon my asking to take\\nback my position in the basement, brought up the wrongs in the admonishment to\\naffirm why they are hesitant, if not reluctant, to allow me to do so. One of my\\nsupervisors hinted that I may just not be stable enough to work in either\\ndepartment, let alone the building. A few of the people in HR have already told\\nme that the department I work for now isn\\'t exactly the most trustworthy, and\\nthat they may have done this in the past.  To try and shorten this all: despite\\nmy having the paperwork to cover me, I fear that my current employers are\\nspreading word about me in an attempt to keep me out of at least two divisions.\\nI fear that if I were to get another position in the building, they will try and\\ncontact that potential employer, as well. I also fear that they will try and\\nfire me for the mistakes made, despite my paperwork stating that I will have\\ntrouble. I\\'m not really sure where to go from here, and would greatly appreciate\\nadvice. If you\\'ve made it this far, I again apologize for rambling.  I work for\\na small c-corp with 50 or less employees in California. The owner needs to\\ncreate a management position to help run day to day aspects. What is the\\nlegality on hiring someone from outside the company and not offering the\\nposition to anyone within the company first? The employees vying for the\\nposition  are trying to convince the owner that she legally has to consider them\\nfirst, but they would not be best for the company. I am trying to convince her\\nto hire from the outside so that our problems are more likely to be solved.\\nHowever, I don\\'t want her to do anything illegal that will harm her business.\\nHelp!    ---        Use the above context and any background question + answer\\npairs to answer the question:   What are the legal issues involving medical\\nmarijuana and employment?

       "# Key Legal Issues Involving Medical Marijuana and Employment\n",
       "\n",
       "The intersection of medical marijuana legalization and employment law creates a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Below are key points outlining the legal issues that arise in this context:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, which conflicts with state laws that have legalized medical marijuana. This dichotomy creates challenges for employers who must comply with federal regulations and for employees who are legally prescribed marijuana under state law.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities. While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect illegal drug use, there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana and potential discrimination claims.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, but it is unclear if medical marijuana use falls under this requirement, especially given its federal illegality.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face challenges with medical marijuana patients who test positive for THC. State laws vary on whether employers can take adverse action based on a positive marijuana test.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, which can lead to prohibiting medical marijuana use in safety-sensitive positions, even if the employee is a legal medical marijuana patient.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, potentially violating laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) if an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed improperly.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not accommodate state laws protecting medical marijuana users, requiring a balance between drug-free workplace policies and employee rights.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Legal questions arise regarding the eligibility of medical marijuana users for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Housing and Land Use**: Employees living in employer-provided housing or certain communities may face restrictions on marijuana use on the property, affecting their ability to use medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Specific provisions in employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may impact medical marijuana users differently.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **Legal Uncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical marijuana use leads to uncertainty and potential litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations under the law.\n",
       "\n",
       "12. **Employer Accommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and revise their accommodation policies to address medical marijuana use, especially in states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations regarding medical marijuana in the workplace. Legal counsel is often necessary to address specific situations."

       "# Key Legal Issues Involving Medical Marijuana and Employment\n",
       "\n",
       "The intersection of medical marijuana legalization and employment law creates a complex legal landscape for both employers and employees. Below are key points outlining the legal issues that arise in this context:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Federal vs. State Law Conflict**: Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, which conflicts with state laws that have legalized medical marijuana. This dichotomy creates challenges for employers who must comply with federal regulations and for employees who are legally prescribed marijuana under state law.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Disability Discrimination**: Employees using medical marijuana may have underlying health conditions that qualify as disabilities. While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not protect illegal drug use, there is a gray area when it comes to state-legal medical marijuana and potential discrimination claims.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, but it is unclear if medical marijuana use falls under this requirement, especially given its federal illegality.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Drug Testing Policies**: Employers with drug testing policies face challenges with medical marijuana patients who test positive for THC. State laws vary on whether employers can take adverse action based on a positive marijuana test.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Safety-Sensitive Positions**: Employers have a duty to maintain a safe workplace, which can lead to prohibiting medical marijuana use in safety-sensitive positions, even if the employee is a legal medical marijuana patient.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Privacy Concerns**: Disclosing medical marijuana use may raise privacy issues, potentially violating laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) if an employee's medical condition or prescription drug use is disclosed improperly.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Zero Tolerance Policies**: Employers with zero-tolerance drug policies may face legal challenges if they do not accommodate state laws protecting medical marijuana users, requiring a balance between drug-free workplace policies and employee rights.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits**: Legal questions arise regarding the eligibility of medical marijuana users for workers' compensation or unemployment benefits if they are injured on the job or terminated for marijuana use.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Housing and Land Use**: Employees living in employer-provided housing or certain communities may face restrictions on marijuana use on the property, affecting their ability to use medical marijuana.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Employment Contracts and Collective Bargaining Agreements**: Specific provisions in employment contracts or collective bargaining agreements may impact medical marijuana users differently.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **Legal Uncertainty and Litigation**: The evolving legal landscape around medical marijuana use leads to uncertainty and potential litigation as parties seek to clarify their rights and obligations under the law.\n",
       "\n",
       "12. **Employer Accommodation Policies**: Employers may need to review and revise their accommodation policies to address medical marijuana use, especially in states with explicit protections for medical marijuana patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, employers and employees must navigate a patchwork of state protections, federal prohibitions, and evolving case law to understand their rights and obligations regarding medical marijuana in the workplace. Legal counsel is often necessary to address specific situations."
