        "summary": "The case Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90 (1992), addressed several pivotal issues in insurance law, with a primary focus on the interpretation of insurance policies, particularly in the context of the insurer's duty to defend the insured against claims. The decision emphasized important principles in contract interpretation such as the duty to defend being broader than the duty to indemnify. The court also highlighted that the determination of an insurer's duty to defend should be based on comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint against the insured to the language of the insurance policy, and in cases of ambiguity, policy provisions should be construed in favor of the insured. These principles have subsequently been applied in various contexts, including questions of coverage exclusions, the known loss doctrine, and the criteria for granting summary judgment in legal disputes.",
