       "1. Similar Type of Item: Both are vintage Appleton explosion-proof industrial ceiling light fixtures, which directly aligns them in terms of type and potential use.\n",

       "4. Specifications: Both lights appear to share specifications such as \"200W - 250V - Type EVA,\" which is relevant when customers look for specific technical requirements.\n",

       "5. Size: The measurements of the candidate are provided, which would be useful to compare with your item to ensure they match in terms of size and scale.\n",
