       "amici curiae Motion Picture Association of America, et al., in support of appellee Recording Industry Association of America. David E. Kendall entered an appearance. Paul Alan Levy, Alan B. Morrison, and Allison M. Zieve were on the brief for amicus curiae Public Citizen. Before: GINSBURG, Chief Judge,and ROBERTS, Circuit Judge, and WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge. Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge GINSBURG. GINSBURG, Chief Judge: This case concerns the Recording Industry Association of America’s use of the subpoena provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512 (h), to identify internet users the RIAA believes are infringing the copyrights of its members. The RIAA served two subpoenas upon Verizon Internet Services in order to discover the names of two Verizon subscribers who appeared to be trading large numbers of .mp3 files of copyrighted music via “peer-to-peer” (P2P) file sharing programs, such as KaZaA. Verizon refused to comply with the subpoenas on various legal grounds. The district court rejected Verizon’s statutory and constitutional challenges to § 512(h) and ordered the internet service provider (ISP) to disclose to the RIAA the names of the two subscribers. On appeal Verizon presents three alternative arguments for reversing the orders of the district court: (1) § 512(h) does not authorize the issuance of a subpoena to an ISP acting solely as a conduit for communications the content of which is determined by others; if the statute does authorize such a subpoena, then the statute is unconstitutional because (2) the district court lacked Article III jurisdiction to issue a subpoena with no underlying “case or controversy” pending before the court; and (3) § 512(h) violates the First Amendment because it lacks sufficient safeguards to protect an internet user’s ability to speak and to associate anonymously. Because we agree with Verizon’s interpretation of the statute, we reverse the orders of the district court enforcing the subpoenas and do not reach either of Verizon’s constitutional arguments. * I. Background Individuals with a personal computer and access to the internet began to offer digital copies of recordings for download by other users, an activity known as file sharing, in the late 1990’s using a program called Napster. Although recording companies and music publishers successfully obtained an injunction against Napster’s facilitating the sharing of files containing copyrighted recordings, see A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 284 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.2002); A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., <mark>239 F.3d 1004</mark> (9th Cir.2001), millions of people in the United States and around the world continue to share digital .mp3 files of copyrighted recordings using P2P computer programs such as KaZaA, Morpheus, Grokster, and eDonkey. See John Borland, File Swapping Shifts Up a Gear (May 27, 2003), available at http:// news.com.com/2100-1026-1009742.html, *88 (last visited December 2, 2003). Unlike Napster, which relied upon a centralized communication architecture to identify the .mp3 files available for download, the current generation of P2P file sharing programs allow an internet user to search directly the .mp3 file libraries of other users; no web site is involved. See Douglas Lichtman & William Landes, Indirect Liability for Copyright Infringement: An Economic Perspective, 16 Harv. J. Law & Tech. 395, 403, 408-09 (2003). To date, owners of copyrights have not been able to stop the use of these decentralized programs. See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 259 F.Supp.2d 1029 (C.D.Cal.2003) (holding Grokster not contributorily liable for copyright infringement by users of its P2P file sharing program). The RIAA now has begun to direct its anti-infringement efforts against individual users of P2P file sharing programs. In order to pursue apparent infringers the RIAA needs to be able to identify the"

I am not able to take a 30 min lunch break off the floor/out of building due to being the only employee in building certified to hold the medication cart keys. Is this legal?

The court's decision indicated that the activities involved were too incidental to direct copyright infringement to constitute a material contribution. It was emphasized that the defendants did not host any infringing files or lists of infringing files, nor did they regulate or provide access to such files. The technology in question, despite attempts to portray it as a method to circumvent previous copyright infringement rulings (Napster I and II), was recognized for its varied applications beyond facilitating copyright infringement. The court notably highlighted the technology's role in significantly reducing distribution costs for public domain and permissively shared content, and in lessening centralized control over distribution. In light of these considerations, the court declined to expand contributory copyright liability as the copyright owners requested. | Would the court's decision apply in a case where a company's technology is primarily used for copyright infringement but has potential legitimate uses?, Can a platform be held liable for contributory copyright infringement if it does not host infringing content but indirectly benefits from the traffic generated by such content?, Does the decision imply that technologies with both infringing and non-infringing uses can always avoid contributory copyright liability?                                                                            | Grokster I, peer-to-peer file-sharing, copyright infringement, material contribution, public domain, permissively shared content, contributory copyright liability, Napster I, Napster II |\n",

The reference to 2007 WL 1246448, along with other case citations, highlights the ongoing questions about the effects of the eBay decision on the standards and presumptions applicable to requests for such injunctions. Specifically, there's an implication that post-eBay, there may no longer be a presumption of irreparable harm in cases seeking permanent or preliminary injunctions, a notion that is considered in light of Amoco Production Co. v.

However, such claims were deemed speculative and insufficient to prove discernible damages. The court suggested that StreamCast may have benefitted from the plaintiffs' refusal to cooperate, likely resulting in increased advertising revenue due to an ineffective filter facilitating direct infringement.

In this context, various film studios alleged that the services and websites maintained by Gary Fung and his company, isoHunt Web Technologies, Inc., induced third parties to download infringing copies of the studios' copyrighted works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Could the precedent set by this case be used to argue that a new file-sharing platform is liable for copyright infringement?, How might this case be cited in arguing for or against the applicability of copyright law to emerging technologies such as blockchain or non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?, In what way does this case influence the legal strategy of companies owning intellectual property rights when dealing with platforms that potentially facilitate copyright infringement?                                                                    | intellectual property, new technologies, film studios, copyright infringement, Gary Fung, isoHunt Web Technologies                                                                        |\n",
       "| 373 F.3d at 555         | Neutral     | The context discusses a legal contention involving the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and a court's instruction related to it. Cox argued that the instruction on the DMCA was highly prejudicial. The precedent established in CoStar Grp., Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., as cited (373 F.3d at 555), holds that the DMCA is \"irrelevant to determining what constitutes a prima facie case of copyright infringement.\" This establishes that the DMCA's significance lies in its ability to limit remedies available against a party found liable for copyright infringement, rather than affecting the establishment of copyright infringement itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | How would the DMCA apply in a case where a service provider is accused of copyright infringement but claims safe harbor protection?, In what circumstances can a party argue that the DMCA's safe harbor provisions do not affect the determination of a prima facie case of copyright infringement?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | DMCA, copyright infringement, safe harbor, prejudicial, CoStar Grp., Inc., prima facie case                                                                                               |\n",
