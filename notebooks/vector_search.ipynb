I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case.\",\n",
       " 'Hello,\\n\\nI was considering getting a medical marijuana card for my back pain. I\\'ve dealt with this chronically for years and it\\'s one of the few things that really help.\\n\\nThe problem is my company has a zero tolerance drug policy. The majority  of our employees are DOT regulated drivers so of course they are not able to able to smoke marijuana even if they have a medical card, this makes sense to me.\\n\\nAs for the rest of us, even us office folk, we are all still subject to randoms.  Basically the logic is that everyone is considered to be in a \"safety sensitive\" position because we can drive on company time or drive a company vehicle. We have a memo in our drug and alcohol handbook to \"all employees\" stating that just because some states have legalized marijuana, does not mean we can disregard company policy. It does NOT say anything about medical cards.\\n\\nI live in Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Is my company able to trump me having a medical card because of their policy?  If I had a random and told the tester  I had a medical card, would it violate HIPAA for the MRO to inform my boss that I tested positive and have a medical card? What can I do? \\n\\nI feel really defeated by my pain and I just wish I could do the one thing that helps me.\\n\\nThank you.',\n",

I don't smoke before or during work and never intend to do so. However I'm unsure about the legality of workers compensation and drug testing during a hire situation if I happen to fail the test. \\n\\nWill I get fired or fined from work and would the employer looking to hire me have grounds to dismiss me?\\n\\nAlso, this is my first time on this sub so I hope this isn't an annoying question or something.\",\n",

He wants to get a medical marijuana card for his medical conditions so he can get off his pain medicine, but the park is telling him that even though he owns his home 100%, because its on the park's land he can't use it or bring it on the property.  Can the park legally do this or is there some legal medical grounds for him?  \",\n",
       " 'Hello. I recently started working as a California 1099 Medical provider with a home health company. Original terms of agreement and understanding was that mileage was covered “from the providers home.” My understanding and what was communicated to me by the person who recruited me, that this meant to and from my house. \\n\\nRecently, the owner now stated the contract is only from the providers home till the last patient. In the contract it states, “starting from the providers home”, and it does not specifically say ending at the last patient’s home. \\n\\nI brought this to the owners attention and he does not agree with me. He stated that its costing the company because many of the providers live outside of the area of patients (I typically live 60 miles away, my residence was known when I was hired). Do I have legal right to be reimbursed for my mileage home or is this a hard lesson to learn from?']"

This concern intersects with several laws and regulations, including but not limited to, employment discrimination laws, medical marijuana laws at the state level, and policies regarding drug testing in the workplace. \n",
       "\n",
       "The most directly relevant case is the first search result. This individual was offered a job in New York, which was later rescinded upon disclosure of their medical marijuana patient status during a pre-employment physical. They reached out to the division of human rights at the labor department for guidance, indicating a potential legal issue surrounding employment discrimination based on medical marijuana use [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gr4q8s/is_it_legal_in_new_york_to_discriminate_against/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "Another pertinent case comes from Arizona, where an individual debated the ramifications of obtaining a medical marijuana card on their employment due to their company's zero-tolerance drug policy [[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e8y7gr/considering_getting_a_medical_marijuana_card/)]. This scenario mirrors the query by highlighting the tension between state-legalized medical marijuana and employer drug policies. \n",
       "\n",
       "The situation described in Pennsylvania also sheds light on this issue. The individual, a medical marijuana cardholder, expressed concerns about drug testing during the hiring process and potential repercussions upon failing the test due to their legitimate medical use of marijuana [[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gnrqby/if_i_have_a_medical_marijuana_card_can_i_be_fired/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the scenario in New Jersey presents a scenario where prescribed medication (though not specifically marijuana) constituted grounds for a job offer being rescinded, which parallels concerns about discrimination based on medical treatments or prescriptions [[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gnpjof/nj_i_was_denied_a_job_due_to_being_prescribed/)].\n",
       "\n",
       "These cases collectively illustrate the complexity of navigating employment and medical marijuana use. They suggest a delicate balance between complying with state laws that permit medical marijuana and adhering to employer drug policies that may not differentiate between recreational and medical use. The legal landscape around this issue appears to be evolving, and the specifics may vary significantly depending on jurisdiction, making it imperative to consider local laws and regulations alongside federal standards when assessing legality."

       "I'm a New York State medical marijuana patient. I also work in healthcare. I applied to a new job at a new hospital, and they are discriminating against me for being a medical marijuana patient. I was offered the job and accepted, but when I went to get my pre-employment physical conducted, I gave them my medical marijuana card and informed them that I am a patient. They are now refusing to hire me. Is this legal? I already contacted the division of human rights at the labor department and they said I may or may not have a case."
